The generally followed the standard fare for a Chinese banquet (i.e. 9 courses, etc.), although it was poorly done. Among the many wedding receptions i have attended, I would have to rate the food here to be the worst I've experienced. Several dishes come to mind: \n1. the fried rice dish included large chucks of rice. Little care was taken in its preparation. \n2. The \"shark fin soup\" tasted stale. \n3. Shitake mushrooms in a vegetable dish were extremely chewy, which means they did not rehydrate them enough, or used very low quality mushrooms.\n4. Crab claws were tiny - the ones offered at local dim sum places are twice the size. \n5. Red bean soup was loaded with sugar....and little else. \n\nThe service was equally bad:\n\n1. As a waiter came by to offer wine, I asked for white. He only had red, and he said he'd come by later. A few minutes later, they took away my glass.\n2. Food was served family style - the wait staff took away the plates without offering guests any remaining food. Even when guests told the waitstaff that the table wasn't finished with the dish, the waitstaff ignored them and still took the dish away. \n3. Only changed our dishes once throughout the meal - normally this is done several times.\n4. Some tables never received cake, whereas at other tables cake was \"served\" twice. These twice-served tables had no one sitting at them, which made it easy for the waiters to simple leave the plates there...\n5. According to the bride, her own father at the head table wasn't served certain dishes since the waiter simply forgot.\n\nFor anyone planning their wedding reception here, I advise you to tread carefully. It was unfortunate that the bride and groom received such poor quality food and service from Holiday Inn, though they did try to make the best of it.

Hotel guests have to park in P-9/P-10 which is 9/10 flights below (we got a bit dizzy going in circles). The elevator is right there, although it only goes as far up to the Food Court level. You then have to walk up a flight of stairs to the lobby to check-in. Because of this set up, there is no one to help you with your luggage if you do self parking. Odd. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed staying here and would gladly stay here again. The neighborhood is a bit dead during the weekends, however the Metro is right in the candy-land convention center across the street and everything is within a 10 minute walk.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uQOBg3NRyrC767zEr1LIgQ"}

When I graduated high school I got an all expenses paid trip to Montreal and this hotel was part of the package. \n\nThis hotel was much fancier that what I am used to, so clearly I was impressed with just about everything. One problem I generally have with hotels [nice or not] is feeling comfortable in the beds and with the pillows. However, the mattress was perfect, not to hard, not too soft. And the pillows were great as well, they had tons of them, some super soft, some a little firm, and a couple hard ones. I found what suited me best and had absolutely no problems sleeping. \n\nThe bathroom was lovely as well, we had a jacuzzi tub and a rather typical shower but we thoroughly enjoyed both! \n\nThe concierge service was fantastic. I had been to Montreal a couple times before but since this time I was with a friend we were looking for anything crazy we could get into. The person we spoke with was completely committed to making sure we knew exactly where we were going, how we were going to get there, and what to expect. This hotel is in a great location and my friend and I felt comfortable walking to all the hot spots we wanted to hit. \n\nCheck out was a breeze, parking was not. Like Michael said, the parking garage was a bit of a maze, but other than that I really enjoyed this hotel!", "type": "review", "business_id": "uQOBg3NRyrC767zEr1LIgQ"}

Hazaaah! And while I was looking forward to my stay at the IM, I was rather disappointed with several elements. Let's just say that my mom runs a way tighter ship. \n\nList of grievances:\n\n- Hidden charges: these were everywhere! Tax and surcharge for room service, no prices anywhere for mini bar (yes, i assumed it was pricey but full disclosure is preferred). Also, who doesn't have free wi-fi these days!?!? Their charge of $10 for 2h is unheard of. Luckily we got a code as part of our meeting but not after a few people had already ponied up the cash.  \n\n- Low quality products: first off, the remote in my room was infuriating! very hard to switch channels, increase volume and sometimes the remote ghost woudl take over and change channels when all I wanted was to mute it for a second. Very bizarre. Also, the towels in the bathrooms were like sandpaper. And i'm not being precious here...they were really rough. Also, it looked like the bathroom hadn't had a good upkeep in years. Paint chips and caulking coming off the bathtub. Verging on ghetto.\n\n- Slightly crusty staff: i had to print out 1 page, sign and fax back to Vancouver during the meeting. I couldn't really believe how crusty the woman was at the desk about it. They like to hold meetings there so isn't this a common request? She could have just told me that the meeting would be charged to use the business center and sent me on my way. Wasn't too sure why it was an issue.\n\n- General cheeziness: i'm not sure if this is a bad thing. One thing about us Quebecois is we like our cheese and not only in curd format. This hotel was clearly designed in the 1990s with it's lobby decked out in faux fur walls, sequins and feathered pillows. Or maybe it was designed last week. That's just a Quebec thing. But it is VERY cheesy. Including the ads for the absinthe bar with the promise of seductive red lips and the green genie. It put me off a bit but then I remembered my roots and just got into it. If you like nouveau chique and modern design this isn't your place though. You've been warned. \n\nAll in all, I think the Coast in Nanaimo is better which is kinda sad when you consider the international level of travelers going through Montreal. I would expect service level to be much higher. But it is walking distance to Old Montreal, Chinatown, downtown and St-Laurent so for the price, probably worth a look.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uQOBg3NRyrC767zEr1LIgQ"}

We were told we had been \"upgraded\" to a room with a view.  And what a view!  We were on the 24th floor for two nights.  The room was spacious and clean.  The king size bed was super comfy- the pillows were ridiculously soft, which may not be for everyone.  The bathroom was big, too, as it had a small shower with good water pressure AND a tub.  And I will mention- as it matters to me- that the hairdryer provided was awesome.  \n\nGenerally, this hotel is great, though wi-fi and breakfast cost extra unlike many hotel deals in Montreal.  We didn't take advantage of the pool or the business center which I suppose are two of the other perks of the hotel.  Generally, stay here if you can find a good deal.

The lobby (and hallways) are beautifully decorated with a retro modern look.  The elevators to the rooms are quick, plentiful, and very clean.  Upon entry into our room, my jaw dropped.  For a hotel room, it was HUGE.  The decor was updated and very welcoming.  The king-size bed was still dwarfed by the room, and it was oh-so-comfortable after a day of exploring Montreal on foot.  There was also a reading chair and ottoman, mini-bar, and large flat-screen TV in the room, and there was still a lot of leftover space!  The closet was also huge.  The bathroom was very clean, marbled, and luxurious as well.  The towels weren't super soft, but that can be overlooked with everything else that the room had going for it.  There's also a phone in the bathroom should you need one (but, really, why would you?).  We felt very pampered and slept SO well in this comfortable, clean, quiet room.  I wished we had a longer stay. :(  \n\nOff the lobby, there's a coffee shop called Java U that serves a plethora of breakfast/lunch choices at very reasonable prices.  We didn't get a chance to try out the bar or other dining options, but they looked very nice.  \n\nUnderground parking is convenient, but a bit pricey here.  It's $20+ per time you exit and/or day, so make sure you only go out once a day if you're going to drive anywhere!  We walked to most places downtown, took the hop-on, hop-off bus tour, and/or jumped on the Metro subway.  (There's a entry to the Underground just across the street from the hotel.  There may even be a connection from the hotel.  It's big enough and we never did explore everything.)  \n\nThe hotel was in a good location, too.

Like a balcony really with a couple of trees.\n\nIt was disappointing to have a great Hotel not meet the expectations or standards of customer service of other high end Hotels.   There are waaaay better Hotels around Montreal for a better price, or higher end Hotels that treat you amazing and it's worth it. I left this place feeling cheated, and disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uQOBg3NRyrC767zEr1LIgQ"}

A little less optimal for Plateau and Parc areas. The rooms are a little tired, not that I really mind usually but for 4 stars +? The lobby however, is very.... Florida contemporary?\n\nTo be honest, I was most disappointed with all of the additional fees. I booked on Priceline and I understand that the confusion might lie there, but still. Requested two beds and was told at check in that two beds would be an additional fee. Self park, additional fee. We brought our pet, additional fee. Wifi? fee! Bottled water - fee! I understand that often there are fees but there was no mention of it, or even the potential fees via Priceline OR the Intercontinental's own site. Once all was said and done we paid almost double per night than I had expected. The staff reduced the fees a little but I was annoyed. After a very long drive and a late evening check in, I was not in the mood. And no, you are not ALWAYS charged for your pet. We have stayed at plenty of hotels where there was no additional fee (I love you Ritz Carlton.) \n\nReally enjoyed the cleaning lady on the 11th floor though, she was lovely. \n\nIn the end it was fine, but too expensive once you added everything up.

There is valet parking and when I arrived, you have to go up an escalator to check-in. It appears this hotel is attached to a mall (?) or inside complex which is very convenient. My boyfriend had checked in the night before so all I had to do was go up. Elevators are near the hotel's main restaurant.\n\nRoom 1906\n\nOur room was a nice corner \"suite.\" It was sizeable and the bathroom was really huge. We didn't stay in the room that much but it was comfortable. Signature flat-screen tv, sitting area, safety deposit box, two closets (nice for extra space) and mini-bar. I wasn't too keen on the bathroom products (it said something about San Francisco) and while I usually love the smell of Lemon Verbena, these products weren't up to snuff. They didn't pass the \"Charlotte takes all the products home\" test.\n\nAmenities\n\nThis hotel has a pool, gym, and spa. The hotel site makes the pool look nice and long, which is perfect for lap swimming. But because there is so much to do and see in Montreal, my boyfriend and I hardly got to use any of the facilities\n\nOne main restaurant and one lounge/bar. My friends and I (we stayed at the same hotel) decided to check out this bar and it wasn't too bad. Another review on that.\n\nValet Parking available. Every time we wanted to go out, we had to call the Concierge to get our car ready. I had slight issues with this as every time I called, there was no one at the Concierge desk. I had to try multiple times, only to call the Front Desk to get my car. \n\nConclusion\n\nI came here with my boyfriend and because he is an IHG member, he stayed here for the points. Overall, I didn't have the best impression of this hotel. Nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary; it's just a place to stay. There was one day when we left at 10AM, returned back at midnight, only to find that our room had not been cleaned at all. The day before, it was cleaned at around 6pm when we were getting ready to go out. This inconsistency for me is a big no-no. Two star deductions (and no, we didn't leave the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on). Staff aren't really friendly either, but perhaps I wasn't being friendly to them?\n\nLocation can't be beat. When one is in Montreal, you don't expect to lounge in the hotel anyways, so really, the InterContinental is just a place to crash. But on that note, I am sure there are cheaper options if you want a just-to-crash hotel. For the price you are paying, there are some expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uQOBg3NRyrC767zEr1LIgQ"}

The trick is pay attention to their trip advisor rating and cross reference it with their star rating. anywho.. \n\n1- Room: They gave us a really nicely sized room, on a high floor with a large bathroom.- which some Hotels don't tend to do with Hotwire reservations, or usually try to give you the bare minimum. \n\n2- Location:  It's a nice little downtown neighborhood of \"Vieux-Montreal\" which is old Montreal. The restaurants around the block are pretty nice, and you'll find an assortment of traditional French cuisine. \n\n\n3- Transportation: There's a Metro Station connected to the Hotel in the \"Montreal World Trade Center\" annex thingy\n\n\n4- Staff: Sweet, Kind and speak English- which came in handy for my better half\n\n5- Amenities:\n\n- Pool: Was ok, but not what I expected out of IHG\n- Sauna:  Needs a little update\n- Gym: Needs a little TLC and update as well\n\n6- On site restaurant: Do not eat at the restaurant- unless you're starved and everything is close. The food is mediocre and priced as you'd expect at an IHG Hotel. The Absinte Bar, on the other hand is a must. The drinks are amazing, and quite potent. The bartender is really sweet and cordial. \n\n\nOverall, I did enjoy my stay at IHG, and would recommend it. However, I think they need to update their \"spa.\"\n\n\nTIP: Signup for their rewards program (it's free) and they'll waive the price of their $15/night WIFI. \n\n----\nBONUS: Oddity of the \"Montreal World Trade Center.\" The Hotel is right next to the St James Hotel and the area between them is enclosed to create some sort of retail/fast-food/ fine dining/ office spaces?

There are a lot of options for lodging on our long weekend getaways to Montreal, but we keep coming back here.  It is a large international chain, so yes, it does lack the charm of a boutique hotel, but when I can score a room here for a scant $120/night over a holiday weekend, it's hard to argue.  \n\nThe rooms have what I'll call an understated regal quality, with deep reds and gold motif.  They're fairly spacious and can offer some very nice city views.  Our first stay here our room overlooked the park just outside next to the very colorful Palais des Congr\u00e9s de Montreal.  The bathroom was amazing with a large tub and separate glass door shower.  The shower was not quite big enough for two (scandalous!) but looked fabulous.  I'm also a fan of the bath products and make sure to ask for extras to take home.  The brand is Agraria and it's their lemon verbena scent.  I'm generally not too into scents, but I love using this shampoo, it just smells so damn invigorating. \n\nOur second stay we were given an interior room overlooking the glass rooftop of the enclosed corridor between the hotel and the building behind it along with glimpses of the river in the background.  Not as good, but still nice and considering the price we paid, no complaints here.  I was slightly disappointed on our second visit to not have a room with separate tub and shower and instead, one with a very standard combo with a curtain.  Room #2 just wasn't as elegant as room #1.  Maybe we were upgraded our first time and just didn't know it?\n\nThe lobby is large, with a decent amount of seating and some interesting decor.  I also love the faux fur panels on the wall as you go down the escalator and the black and white plates displayed on the wall near the bar area.  Check-in has always been painless, though this may have a lot to do with arriving close to 10 pm each time, having driven up from the Boston area.  Staff is very much bilingual, so English-only speakers should have no issues.\n\nThe location is great, as it's very close to all your major tourist stuff in Old Montreal, shopping (or other activities) along St Catherine, not to mention, you can get on the Metro without setting foot outside.  Parking is not cheap, I believe $25/night for self park, or $35 or valet.  If you plan to do any driving around, do the valet, as the hourly parking fee applies each time you go in and out, a lesson I learned the hard way once.  Of course, this past trip we opted for valet and never use the car once, wasting $30 over the course of three nights.

The only time they were delayed, we had the do not disturb sign on the room until shortly after 10 am and we were back to the room at 4 to rest and they were cleaning so we went to the rooftop patio to relax until they were done. They are not mind readers and I did not expect them to clean the room the moment we left especially when they had completed servicing the other rooms on our floor, so I think that was reasonable. Our only complaint was that the pool was quite small and has short hours. We have never been to hotel with a pool that closes at 7pm before and it did not give us any time to enjoy it at all since we had busy days and were frequently not back to the hotel until at least 9-10.

We were only the second group in the place, so we did not experience the slow service of other reviewers. Our server was very attentive, seemed to be in a great mood, and knew her beer! \n\nWe started with two order of the mixed perogies, which were brought out right away. Our server recommended that we order them first and then see if we were still hungry. Being generally a hungry bunch, we ordered more. I ordered the mielony, my brother's girlfriend ordered the cabbage rolls, and my brother ordered the schnitzl (excuse my spelling, not sure if it's correct).

The menu offered three choices for complete meals... a Polish sampler type feast, fish (filet of sole, I think) and roast wild boar.  The meals included borsht, a green salad, entre, dessert and coffee.\n\nThe borsht was basically a beef consume flavored with beet.  It was served with sour cream.  Not like any borsht I've ever had, but not too bad.\n\nThe salad came with a house dressing to compliment the lettuce (only lettuce) hence the \"green\" description.\n\nThe Polish sampler plate was tasty and satisfying.  The roast wild boar was so dry and tough, it was nearly inedible.  According to the waiter, \"wild boar has a different texture than pork\" (apparently a shoe leather texture!).  I left all but  the first bite for the garbage bin.\n\nThe dessert was an apple strudel and was very good.  My wife asked to substitute the poppyseed cake ($1 more) for the strudel.  The waiter  agreed to do it at no extra charge since \"I didn't like my entre\".  Honestly... the strudel was a much better choice!\n\nClearly the most memorable part of the evening was the talented piano player who effortlessly turned Pink Floyd, Blackeyed Peas and other favorites into \"elevator music\".\n\nNext time, we'll probably stop in just for dessert, coffee and piano.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

But, we tucked this in the back of our minds and I'm glad we did!\n\nThe staff was an extremely pleasant woman who was fluent in English, Polish, and French.  She was sweet, attentive, and knew the city like the back of her hand.  She recommended our vodka and suggested to accompany it with apple juice, a \"chaser\" if you will.  She said it was \"how the Polish do it\", so why not?  When in Rome.....It was smooth, strong, and I felt content immediately.  The turpentine aftertaste (all vodka does to me, regardless of brand, but some better than others!) was immediately quashed by the sweetness of the juice.  I will never drink vodka any other way hereafter!\n\nI am an embarrassment to my Polish and Irish heritage - I hate cabbage (!) - so I went with the pierogies.  Cheese.  My husband was easily swayed into the  gobki.\n\nMy dish came artfully arranged with a sprinkle of dill, a heaping side of sauerkraut and carrot shaped into a rosette.  My husband's order was accompanied by a cucumber/dill sauce mix and sliced boiled potatoes.\n\nThe pierogies tasted like my Bab\u00e7i came back to life and got work in their kitchen.  Very authentic.  Dipped in the side bowl of sour cream, it was delicious!\n\nMy husband inhaled his dish (and half of mine) within seconds, which usually is a sign he likes it.  The gobki appeared to have an abundance of ground meat, which is a nice change from the rice-laden  cabbage rolls I usually see.  He stated the tomatoes were an excellent topping, as it was a bit dry inside of the roll.  He found the cucumber/dill muxture to be divine.  Not his words, but \"wicked good\" isn't exactly poetry, but a good description nonetheless!\n\nThe ambience is divine and the bar nicely stocked.  (side note: the building's side door also gives access to bathrooms without going through the restaurant). Our waitress informed us live music is usually at the restaurant nightly of we wanted to cone back for dessert and Polish coffee (coffee with vodka....of course!)\n\nThe menu may have been simple and don't offer a huge array of options, but sometimes that can be overwhelming.  So points today for simplicity.\n\nIf you are a fan of Polish food - this is authentic as it gets.  A MUST when in Montreal and desire something different than American and after a few days in Quebec, something different than French!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

No joke!\n\nThe staff here are very friendly, however note: The service is European-style. Do NOT expect prompt, speedy service with multiple check backs and all that. One person (when they're ready) will take your order, someone else brings your food, and then you pretty much linger..and linger, and so forth...But, its all good, if you go in expecting this type of laid back hospitality (similar to most restaurants in Montreal). \n\nWe were encouraged to order some vodka to go with our meals...Yes!!! But, we were quite thirsty and each opted to have a nice 20oz pour of Montreal's foremost microbrew: Saint- Amboise for $7.00C. Great choice as it pairs well with this type of hearty cuisine.\n\nFor our meals we ordered a few different popular choices and turned our table into a Smorgasbord. Our choices: Pierogi, filled with meat and cheese, served with fresh sour cream $15.25C (best pierogi I've ever had, whaat??), Golabaki, meat stuffed cabbage served with potatoes and vegetables $12.75C (again, phenomenal), and Placki, potato pancakes served with fresh sour cream and sweet chunky homemade applesauce $11.25C (to die for!).\n\nNeedless to say, I will definitely be making this a routine spot to hit when ever I'm in the great city of Montreal.

I first needed a restroom, and beautiful brunette gave me directions to the facilities.  \n     I've got to comment on the bathrooms, or rather the pathway too them.  Out the restaurants door I found myself in an old stone mason stairway, wooden stairs creaked as I climbed them. I could feel the history of this place. This was the old Montreal I was looking for. I savored the walk to the bathroom as long as I could, but beautiful brunette would be waiting for my lunch order. \n     The menu was good, and I found myself torn between two items.  In cases like this, I tend to get an opinion of an employee. So I asked beautiful brunette which item she preferred. She picked one and I ordered it.  It was a saut\u00e9ed filet of sole, with a salad and potato. Beautiful brunette said it wasn't actually a polish dish, and I was okay with that.\n     The fish came out, it looked and smelled delicious.  A filet covered in slivered almonds sat next to a salad and skinned potatoes.  I ate them, and they were delicious. A band struck up a merry tune outside at a festival going on a few streets away.  Every now and again a cool breeze would blow in through the great opened window behind me. The meal experiance was magical.\n      Beautiful brunette visited me often, filling my water glass, and checking on my progress with the delicious meal.  The bill ended up around 20 bucks with tax and tip.\n\n   I'm way glad I ate here, and not at the five guys burgers down the street. I would recommend it, and their bathroom to anybody visiting.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

These were recommended by our excellent waiter, who pretty much picked out our entire supper for us, checked in just a couple of times, and otherwise let us enjoy our evening.\n\nDelicious, homey, and reasonably-priced fare, we definitely enjoyed dining here and would love to come back next time we're in town.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

Ordered barszcz, zurek (soups), krokiet with mushrooms (started), all of their dumplings and kotlets - all of which was splendid. Soups were nice and flavorful and tasted home-made, krokiet was delicate, not greasy, subtly mushroomy, all of the dumplings tasted awesome (meat ones would be my favorite) kotlets were huge and tasty. Only complain was from my dad, who wanted more of their side potatoes - he's one big starch-loving traditionalist) and from me to increase their Polish beers selection (although they had some nice local beers, so that's just my wishful thinking). Decor was very nice too, ambiance was great, live music added on to that. Prices were very reasonable too.

I had not been to the restaurant in a few years and hoped it would be just as good.\n\nAs soon as you walk in, you are met with that familiarity of having been here before. The piano player is tickling the ivories, the lighting is just bright enough, that each table feels like it is in its own little private area.\n\nIf you like Polish food or have never tried it, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. There are dishes on the menu, that remind me somewhat of what my grandmother used to make for us.\n\nWe started off our meal with drinks and being in a Polish restaurant, we started off with a round of Polish vodka, Wyborowa. Nicely chilled and a great way to start off any meal; but I guess any meal that starts with a round of drinks is a nice way to start.\n\nWe got an assortment of appetizers to start with. A few people got the Flaki soup (a Polish soup made of tripes) and we also got pierogis, plaki, kielbasa, and sledz (herring). On a side note, I don't like herring, however, I decided for the first time to try the one from Stash after my brother convinced me that it is really good. OMG, he was right, I now know what herring should be made like (sorry grandma), but that was really good. What better to have with herring, than vodka, so round two was ordered. Hey, it's a celebration.\n\nThree people at the table got the sznycel wiedenski (veal schnitzel), someone got the Bigos (a type of Polish stew), and one golabki (cabbage rolls). There was a lot of sharing and trading of plates and each was excellent, although the golabki could have used a little more salt and the Bigos a little less salt. However, I would recommend either of those dishes in a heart beat. The portions are well sized and quite filling.\n\nFor dessert we got struddel, although I was surprised that a Polish restaurant didn't have p\u0105czki (Polish doughnut). When I asked about it, when making the reservation, the lady told me where I could find them; but I wasn't sure if she meant I could bring them with me or she was just simply being nice and telling me where I could buy them.\n\nThe meal, with tax and tip (and I was very generous with the tip because our waiter was great) was 308$. That was for 5 meals, 6 entrees, 2 rounds of vodka shots, 2 martinis, bottle of wine, and dessert.

It was a good experience overall but I don't think they quite stand up to many of the other restaurants in the area.  I likely would return if I were specifically craving Polish food, but otherwise I would probably head to one of the other restaurants in the area.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

I wanted to do something different for a restaurant outing this time and chose to eat Polish food since I've never really had...plus it's so different from Asian cuisine. This place is just so cute with wooden-like decor and a piano player as a bonus. Each table had a fresh tulip in a vase and awesome lighting that reminds me of a jellyfish. \n\nThe waiter was very attentive and the service was pleasant. I ordered this dish (which I will not name here but describe because I don't want to butcher the language) that was basically breaded fairly large nuggets that were made of ground pork with mushroom sauce/beet salad/potatoes. It was seriously satisfying and I really enjoyed it. Beet salad was quite delicious too! Not too sour/sweet.  My bf had the pierogies (sp? correct my spelling if it's wrong) but they are essentially Polish dumplings with mushroom, cheese, and potatoes. Those were enjoyable too. Portion sizes were just right and not overwhelming. \n\nThe dinner was definitely different than what I usually am used to but I really recommend coming here because they have live piano playing, I'm assuming around dinner time. So not only do you get to eat awesome food, you get to hear awesome music playing! Not too shabby...not too shabby.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

Tout ce que je sais de la cuisine polonaise, c'est qu'elle comporte beaucoup de patates. Allons y maintenant pour la critique.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 ambiance, ce petit resto est parfait. La d\u00e9co fait tr\u00e8s \"vieille Europe\" et l'\u00e9difice historique dans lequel il est sis y contribue grandement. Je sais aussi que le soir, on y retrouve un pianiste qui joue de la musique tr\u00e8s vivante et que l'endroit est souvent bond\u00e9 en saison haute.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 service, c'est l\u00e0 que \u00e7a se g\u00e2te un peu. Les serveuses sont toutes tr\u00e8s gentilles, mais bon Dieu qu'elles sont lentes! La journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 j'y suis all\u00e9, c'\u00e9tait un apr\u00e8s-midi pas mal calme. Elles \u00e9taient trois au bar \u00e0 ne rien faire et \u00e7a leur a pris beaucoup trop longtemps \u00e0 me remarquer dans l'entr\u00e9e. Cette lenteur aura \u00e9t\u00e9 caract\u00e9ristique de notre repas, l'allongeant bien plus qu'il s'en faut.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 bouffe, c'\u00e9tait bon, mais sans plus. En fait, je dirais que c'\u00e9tait ordinaire. Sourtout le dessert. Peut-\u00eatre que c'\u00e9tait de l'excellente cuisine polonaise, je n'en sais rien, mais je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais... Le meilleur plat que j'ai mang\u00e9 -- surprise totale -- c'\u00e9tait mon entr\u00e9e : du hareng marin\u00e9 servi avec des oignons rouges, une salade de pommes r\u00e2p\u00e9es et de la cr\u00e8me s\u00fbre, \u00e7a m'a beaucoup plu. Vint ensuite, un sanglier en daube aux oignons et au vin, avec chou rouge brais\u00e9 et pommes de terre. Le sanglier \u00e9tait trop cuit pour \u00eatre un r\u00f4ti (ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e9crit au menu), mais pas assez pour \u00eatre \"en daube\", donc relativement dur. La sauce \u00e9tait go\u00fbteuse, mais tr\u00e8s grasse et les patates tr\u00e8s fades. Mon \u00e9l\u00e9ment pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9tait le chou, qui acidul\u00e9, coupait bien le graisseux du reste de l'assiette. Vint enfin le pire \u00e9l\u00e9ment du repas : une esp\u00e8ce de croustade aux p\u00eaches assez infecte. Le croustillant \u00e9tait mou, dans le genre \"j'ai plusieurs jours de r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration derri\u00e8re moi\" et les fruits criaient la conserve. Le seul plus de l'assiette : le tout \u00e9tait noy\u00e9 de smetana, une cr\u00e8me s\u00fbre sucr\u00e9e. H\u00e9las il n'y en avait pas assez pour masquer compl\u00e8tement le go\u00fbt d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able de cette chose. Mon compagnon, pour sa part, avait command\u00e9 le barszcz (version polonaise de la soupe aux betteraves ukrainiennes) go\u00fbteux, mais liquide, suivi de l'assiette du d\u00e9butant, constitu\u00e9e de patates, de choucroute, de patates, de saucisse, de patates, le tout accompagn\u00e9 de patates. Ah j'oubliais : il avait aussi des patates. Son assiette n'\u00e9tait pas froide, mais pas chaude non plus, probablement \u00e0 cause de la lenteur du service. D\u00e9j\u00e0 que des pierogis ce n'est pas excellent, imaginez s'ils sont \u00e0 peine ti\u00e8de! Son dessert lui, \u00e9tait identique au mien, mais farci de pommes, ce qui le rendait un peu plus agr\u00e9able, malgr\u00e9 la trop forte dose de canelle.\n\nVoil\u00e0 ma critique du Stash Caf\u00e9. Mon verdict? C'\u00e9tait int\u00e9ressant de d\u00e9couvrir cette cuisine pratiquement inconnue, surtout au Qu\u00e9bec, mais je n'y retournerai probablement pas. Par contre, si jamais j'y vais encore, je m'assurerai que ce sera \u00e0 une heure de plus grand achalandage. Le service sera s\u00fbrement plus rapide et les plats encore chauds.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

We were a group of nine and at first we started kind of slowly with the drinks and orders, as soon as our choice was made appetizers and mains started coming quickly, and orderly. \n\nThe food in Stash was perfect for the rainy fall evening, filling, warming and quite delicious. I had the tripe soup, which was amazing, very well seasoned and the tripe was excellently cooked. The two starters we tried were the herring, single piece of fish garnished with apples and sour cream, and the  potato pancakes. The potato cakes were just Ok, but I'm a big fan of the herring. The main courses were perfectly prepared. If you opt for schnitzel you would not regret and it comes with wonderful red beet salad. The star of the dinner with no doubt were the pierogi, there are three flavours to choose from, the meat ones being my favourite. We naturally went with the Polish and Czech beers as a drink choice, but the menu offers good wine list and some vodkas if you'd like to consume your herring appropriately. \n\nThe restaurant has cute atmoshphere, the little benches used for seating may be a little bit uncomfortable if you fit three grown up people in them. However, the good food compensates for it. The live piano performance is wonderful. I can easily see myself coming again for some soup and pierogi, and glass or more of wine.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

We had made hasty reservations elsewhere but upon discovering that it had an ambience somewhere between a punk rock club and a frat party a quick change of plans was needed. It was Saturday night and Vieux Montreal was hopping; would we be stuck eating Poutine again? We spotted this place and it looked busy but it never hurts to try. Surprisingly and to our relief, she looked around and said just a few minutes and I can fit you in. Great!\n\nSo we sat on a bench inside while we waited and took in the ambience. It was completely full, with tables of all sizes densely packed. But not in a claustrophobic way. The effect was almost like a jigsaw puzzle: the tables as interlocking pieces filling the cozy historic stone-walled dining room. Soon our table was ready and we were escorted, right into the heart of the animated scene.\n\nWe looked at the menu and everything looked good, with all the standard Polish fare one would expect. But for some reason we were both attracted to the appetizers. There were six and we wanted them all. So we pointed to the appetizer page page and asked for \"one of everything\". Plus a salad.\n\nNow probably appetizers are not the best way to judge a restaurant, as they can sometimes be rather simple and not where the chef shows off his talents. But no matter. They were all very good and exactly what we hoped for. We had: Krokiet (breaded crepe roll stuffed with meat and mushrooms), Placki (potato pancakes), Pierogies (pastries stuffed with various savory fillings), Kielbasa sauteed with onions, Sledz (picked herring), and something else which escapes me. All simple plain food, just what we expected and hoped for. The only surprise to me was the sauerkraut: much milder than I am used to, with less salt and vinegary tang. I liked it though.\n\nI'd love to go back someday and try some of the entrees. Maybe next visit?\n\nFor dessert we got a slice of hazelnut cake. Plenty big enough to share. Good enough though not memorable.\n\nSome Yelpers have mentioned problems with the service. I couldn't disagree more. Our server was efficient, friendly, and made us feel right at home from the moment we came inside.\n\nI almost forgot to mention the piano player. He sat at an ancient upright piano and played throughout the evening. Mostly old jazz and jazzy renditions of old pop tunes. I only wish we would have played some Chopin (who was Polish).

Genius isn't it? \n\nThe plate was like a Christmas present to me because I was excited to try everything but I wasn't sure what to expect. Everything was delicious especially the pierogi (dumplings) and the krokiet which was a roll covered in breadcrumbs with a meat filling. I don't know which kind meat the krokiet's filling was (maybe beef) but it didn't matter because it quickly slid down into my belly! As for the pierogi, those were heavenly. The dough was al dente and the filling was rich. I want more of those miniature pillows!", "type": "review", "business_id": "qM2I6EnvzeVDN93StYkIYA"}

Good friends of our are Polish & have cooked for us as well. Additionally, we've made at least 18 long trips to Hungary where they serve food similar to Polish cuisine so we've had our share of sausages, borscht, etc.\n\nWe ate at Stash Cafe twice during a visit to Montreal in August this year. On our second visit we also took a German friend. Quite frankly, we all loved this place and the food. Two other of our friends dined at Stash Cafe in the last month & also loved the food. The interior is cozy & has some nice Polish artworks on display. On both our visits were walk-ins, but it does tend to get busy, so perhaps reservations are a good idea. \n\nWe had numerous dishes between us: bigos, pierogi, kielbasa, golabki (stuffed cabbage), & a wonderful charcuterie plate & even the smalec (a spread of bacon fat). Everything we had was delicious! Service was friendly & helpful.

I had the mushrooms and it was great, I gobbled it up fast.\n- barszcz soup, which is beets soup, deep wine red in colour and supposedly spicy. Stash's is not spicy at all, but still flavourful and quite nice. It's best when hot so don't let it sit!\n\nThe best Polish dishes are perhaps at your Polish friend's home, but Stash Cafe fills the void and with wonderful service. They have Polish beer and wine, as well as the incredibly delicious crepes with cheese, topped with sugar, sweet strawberries and fruits.

Being a fan of Swiss Chalet, I wanted my family to have a comparison basis between the two, so, I went with a friend of mine. \n\nIt was busy on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm, and we had to wait for a table. Not an unreasonable wait. When we finally got a table, it was near the back in a large booth that accomodated us. \n\nFood was good, standard quarter chicken dinner with ribs. My friend had chicken and a salad. My wife had a quarter chicken dinner and my kids had the nuggets which came in a \"cab\" shaped container, they thought it was quite novel. Naturally, there is colouring for the kids. \n\nRefills on soft drinks were a little dicey, and I think I was charged another $3 for a refill, something they don't do at Swiss Chalet in Ontario. I did ask my friend whether it was just the fact that they were picking on us because we were from Ontario and whether as a Quebecer, they got free refills. He just looked at me like I was from Mars and advised me very politely that he doesn't ask for refills. \n\nThe food was good and filling, portions were good for me.

It's very conveniently located right at Place Des Festivals and always booming with tourists and locals in town for a special event or show.\n\nUnfortunately, the food is rather bland and service is lacking.\n\nTheir classic rotisserie chicken for which they are supposed to be known for is often dry (chicken skin wouldn't peel off nicely, it was all dry and stuck) and portions are extremely small. Not sure what kind of chicken they use, but if I order a quarter leg elsewhere, I see a big difference in size.\nIt's not just the chicken, but pretty much any side you get with it, you'll get very little. The equivalent of a small handful of fries, or if you want rice, looks like they use an ice cream scoop to measure it out.\n\nYes they do have unlimited cole slaw, bread and sauce - but it's only as much as they will serve you. Because service is often slow, it's a hassle to search for your waiter and they almost make you feel bad for asking more.\n\nThere are times where the service is fast, but not in a good way, and this is usually on an evening where there's a big show at Place Des Arts. The staff  is aware that many people will need to be done by a certain time, so they practically chase you out and give you the bill before you have time to ask for dessert.\n\nI wouldn't bother with dessert anyways, the fact that they have an open kitchen, you can see how the food is prepared and they use microwaves to reheat their cakes.\n\nOnce I came with my family, busy like always, they couldn't even get us proper drinks. Soda was flat and warm, the glass was colder than the drink itself.\n\nFood quality is inconsistent, portions are a joke. I never leave there feeling full or satisfied. St-Hubert is only loosely worth it if you go to an Express restaurant where the prices are slightly cheaper and you don't have to tip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E9Uleq1P0ZSILv2YUWW_JQ"}

We had the specialty st. hubert poutine which was really good - the sauce was just a bit heavy and not really my favorite. Of course we ordered the chicken which was prepared beautifully, not one part overcooked. Also tried the ribs which come in either small or large and the small was plenty, and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Outdoor seating is very pleasant, especially in the evening when it's kind of windy, patio is right on St. Catherine st. Cole slaw that was served with the dinner was amazing, honestly some of the best I've had. But if anything it was the service that won me over!

St-Hubert is a rotisserie chain and yes not the best place for vegetarians. \n\nThe restaurant was recently completely renovated. Overall it looks good and it appears there is more space for tables. Finally, they pushed the bathrooms further back and there is no more table right next to them (where I was seated multiple times and it was quite unpleasant). Little problems in the bathroom: only 1 out of 3 faucets was working and my friend and I never understood how we were supposed to lock the doors...\n\nThe location is essential for this one: right in the Quartier des spectacles and so it is always busy and surprisingly efficient. On a Thursday night, my friend and I had tickets to the ballet at 8PM. We hoped to be seated around 6:30. \n\nEvery evening, especially on \"concert nights\", you must expect the place to be packed, with a line. Hence you have to get there early. I arrived at 6:10 and I was told I would have to wait AT LEAST 20-25 minutes. There must have been 8 groups of people before us. \n\nWe got a table at 6:40. We didn't take too long to order our food and we had finished our meal by 7:20. We had plenty of time to get a dessert, which is probably the best thing on their menu, because they have a lot of options. Tourists, you have to try the sugar pie (i.e. maple syrup pie). \n\nThe food itself isn't fantastic, especially the fries. They are never particularly crispy. Overall, there's a lot of salt in the food. Not mind-blowing experience, but if you have a show in the area, St-Hub is a simple and fast option. It is definitely a kid-friendly place.

It indeed was a surprise.  I guess they changed the name so any disappointed customers wouldn't blame the Chef.\n\nQuarter chicken leg meal... more like a QUARTER BOX meal since the piece was so small, that's how much space it took up in the take out container, which by the way contained a tray that was tapered at the bottom.  Found the chicken to be saltier than other roast chicken places.  Maybe they marinate it in brine before roasting.  The downside is that salt is its predominant flavour.  The fries were crispy and actually not bad.  Switched the salad for an extra gravy which I didn't really need but this man needs meat, not salad, and he got neither.  Still, for those with decent appetites or meat lovers, pay for the more expensive chicken breast meal instead.  After all, there's no time to eat lunch twice.\n\nOverall, something different from the Swiss Chalet I'm used to but seeing since there must be some anti-competitive agreement (no St. Hubert in Ontario, no Swiss Chalet in Quebec) between the companies, it's likely Quebecers are stuck with whatever St. Hubert decides to dish out.\n\nPrices are a little on the expensive side but simply put where else are you going to go for chain restaurant roast bird.\n\nP.S.  From what I've been told, that mysterious one half hamburger bun comes from the fact that it used to be a whole hamburger bun being used as the bread portion of the meal, until the company cut back and started giving one half the amount.", "type": "review", "business_id": "E9Uleq1P0ZSILv2YUWW_JQ"}

They even sale stove-top expresso makers!\n\nNow let's get back in track, this boys and girls are well thought on how to make a latte to perfection! The coffee used is The Royal, (and yes you can also buy it there to brew it at home too) every single shot is individually grinded, freshness like that I haven't found nowhere else, the milk is warmed up to your suggestion and the foam comes always like a cloud from heaven, a perfect cafe au lait!

We dined here twice - the 1st time I ordered the savory Oy Vegg (latkes, eggs, grilled tomatoes & sour cream, came w/ fruit & toast).

During our first visit, we were practically ignored for the initial few minutes we were in this restaurant, then once seated, ignored a while longer (it wasn't that busy).  Our waitress was - well, not UNfriendly, but kind of... void.  (The waiter who had seated us & got us menus was a bit more cordial).

You're still groggy from a night of Montreal festivities, you search on your phone for breakfast or maybe ask the hotel front desk where to go for breakfast, and you wind up here, in a kinda cool/trendy decorated space.\n\nThen you notice the LINE.  And the host (once they finally notice you in the back of the line after 5 minutes) tells you the wait right now is about 45 min to an hour.  So you think 'Hmm well if all these people are here to wait in line then this place MUST be great!' \n\nAnd that, dear readers, is the logical, yet incorrect assumption.  Because what you don't realize that this place is basically the first stop for hoards of tourists who were directed (like yourself) to this very mediocre eating establishment, and now that all of you are finally here, and waiting in line, you say to yourself, \"people wait hours for amazing food in the metropolitan city where i'm from, this must be one of those places.\"  The other problem is the tourists in Montreal generally come in packs, so there's a lot of underage college/high school kids in groups of 6-10 who will be fighting you for tables.   \n\nOne of the problems is the service is incredibly slow.  I watched the host/hostess bussing tables and even getting sucked into taking orders while the line kept piling up and nobody was bringing order to the chaos, while empty tables weren't even being used.  The other problem is their waiter/waitress ratio for the size of the restaurant is totally out of whack.  Eggspectations are pretty big, maybe 40-50 tables and 2 stories, and on several occasions I've been here each waiter/waitress is trying to handle something like 10-15 tables.\n\nIf the food were out of this world I might overlook these shortcomings, but really, it's very mediocre diner food, on par with Denny's or IHOP, (which has much better service).  For a local alternative, do yourself a favor and walk to Olive et Gourmando for a proper breakfast.

I stopped in because I am chocolate fan and this had been recommended by a tourist I had met on the subway.  They sell the standard cafe food (sandwiches, soup, and I think salads) in addition to chocolates. I had a vegetable sandwich which was good, but not outstanding. I also took home a box of chocolates. (There was no way I was getting out of there without one.) They only make a small variety of chocolates (usually with some type of filling), but they are exquisite bite-sized chocolates worthy of your baby shower, dinner party, or loved one on Valentine's Day.  Either way, they are definitely something to share.  The chocolates are sweet without being cloying and each filling is a pleasant surprise that ranged from chocolate mousse to lemon to caramel to some type of maple.  And they are pretty to look at.  Out of a box of sixteen distinct chocolates, there wasn't a single one I didn't like. The decor is casual cafe and most patrons (most look like tourists) stay to linger over coffee.  Table space is at a premium, but you won't be crowded.  Beware, the prices are reasonable for the food, but the chocolates are sold by weight with the price on the steep side (but still worth a taste).  It's right down the street from the Basilica Notre Dame so it's near the Place d'Armes Metro stop, but still a bit of hike.\n\nThat said, I don't think this place is worthy of drawing patrons outside of those visiting or working in Old Montreal, but definitely worthy of a visit if you are in the vicinity and is definitely a casual alternative to the usual cafe fare in most tourist areas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "WX89Rq2O_ri18jao1Gl0yg"}

We finished the appetizers, wine and broccoli, but left half the fried rice and 3/4 of the tofu. It was all really delicious- we just couldn't finish it. With our check, they gave us 8 slices of oranges and 3 fortune cookies. Yummy! The meal took just the right length of time, and as we were leaving, there was a decent line of people waiting to be seated.\n\nDefinitely go if you're hungry and looking for solid, cheap Chinese food.

The soup base was under seasoned (we added soy sauce) but the shrimp cakes were extremely flavorful and the greens were bright and still had a bit of a crunch. The eggrolls were way too oily and just had salted bean sprouts in it...gross. The salt and pepper shrimp was incredible. I removed all the fried parts from mine and the flavor was still incredibly strong. The shrimp themselves were high quality.  The fried rice was flavorful but subtle ( soy sauce wasn't the main ingredient). Finally we had a chicken stir fry - amazing. The chicken was so moist and high quality and the vegetables were perfectly prepared. The food was so good and so high quality, I wondered how they could afford to basically give it away.\n\nService: Terrible. I am usually a very generous tipper, but this was a no tip situation. We got our first two dishes relatively fast. Then a huge party sat behind us, the place got a little busy and they forgot about us...for half an hour plus. When we were finally able to get the waiters attention(we were in a corner) he came over annoyed and waved us away as we tried to explain that we hadn't gotten our main dishes. He brought the dessert serving and then the check. When we tried to explain again that we hadn't gotten our main courses, he didn't believe us, had to bring another waiter over to verify before finally getting our food 10 mins later.

They have everything from gelato, tarts, chocolates, muffins, and mouses. I bought a dark chocolate maple hazelnut tart...it was absolutely delicious! \n\nThey also have a mini museum downstairs that shows you how they use to collect sap and how they made maple syrup back in the day. And then it shows you how they make it today. Apparently it takes 40 saps to make very little syrup which I thought was crazy! During my taste test, I also tried a maple syrup spread. It was yummy, but I am on a budget so I didn`t wanna spend the $11. This place is definitely worth visiting while you are here in Old Montreal.

About the best thing I can say is that they had a semi-clean restroom (only one that day; the second was out of order).\n\nI wanted to go because there was a site that said this location had a \"Maple Museum\". I do so love museums. But when we got there, it was so uninspired. They had information on the walls, sure, and some pieces of equipment specific to the maple trade, but it seemed to fall well short of \"museum\" status.\n\nSo, the \"museum\" (and the restroom) is downstairs. Upstairs, you have the shop, which will sell you all things maple - from souvenirs to gelato to drinks. Neither of us had ever had real maple syrup before, so we were eager to sample the true maple wares. We stood in the long line snaking around the store in order to get a couple of gelatos and cookies (because we had to have a decent sampling, right?) before escaping the crush of people upstairs to snag a small, dirty table downstairs.\n\nI'm sure this is my Americanized-palate speaking, but I wasn't a fan of the gelato. I'm glad I only got one scoop. It wasn't that it wasn't very sweet (which I was okay with, to be honest). No, to me, at least, there was an off-taste that I wasn't fond of. I didn't want to say anything to my husband, because I didn't want to complain about something that I had been so gung-ho about, but he asked me what I thought, and I wasn't about to lie to him.\n\nHe actually agreed, which makes me think that it IS the fact that we're used to the fake stuff that threw us. \n\nWe didn't eat the cookies at that point - we were both full from lunch and the gelato - but we did eat them later that day, and again, that off-flavor that neither of us can put our finger on was present in the cookies, as well.\n\nSo, is it fair to give such a low rating based on my dislike of the food? Maybe not, but let me also say this: the employees were not friendly that day. Yes, they were busy, but I don't think that gives servers free reign to be flat-out nasty to customers. Further, the downstairs \"museum\"/eating area had a general grunge to it that made me wonder when it was last cleaned, and the bathroom needed some real attention.\n\nIt was an experience, yes, but not one that either of us wanted to repeat during our time in Montreal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "t578Gz0FdfudO_57qptVkA"}

First of all, read the reviews on the travel websites and realize that this is NOT a luxury hotel.  Really, it's more of an old apartment building.  I didn't explore the hotel much since our room was right next to the check-in counter, but I don't think they had any common areas.  The free breakfast is served in your room -- toast, jelly, peanut butter, croissant, and choice of coffee or tea.  The rooms were old and obviously outdated, but everything was actually pretty clean.  They have one of those painful, water-saving shower heads.  The towels are more worn than my cleaning rags, so you may want to consider bringing your own.  Free parking is in the back of the hotel -- there are tandem spots that can fit eight cars, but you have to leave your keys at the front desk in case they need to shift the cars around.  \n\nThe reason why \"I'm a fan\" of this place is not because it's particularly nice, but because it's exactly what I needed for a short trip on a grad student budget.  Where they lack in amenities, they more than make up for in price and location.  It's located downtown and within walking distance of many tourist attractions -- we walked to Mont Royal, Old Montreal, Old Port, and Chinatown.  If you're not a fan of walking, there is also a subway stop less than two blocks away.  \n\nOverall, a good deal for the price relative to other places in the area -- but at that price, you really can't expect it to be all that nice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ZHjG7GleA5xBrq7DLxcZNg"}

Table with chairs, a sofa, a good closet. So far so good! The bathroom made me giggle every time I was in there: old materials, decently clean, but with a lose toilet seat, a disgustingly dirty bath curtain, 3 drops of water that came from the shower head, towels so small and thin that after drying your hair there's no more towel left for your body, it was hilarious.

Fortunately we  had all our valuables on us and didn't miss anything and the manager sincerely apologized but what a huge failure. The beds were fine as was the quite.

The hotel was super hard to find on a rainy night. The sign wasn't really lit, but it's right next to the Hotel Place des Arts, which sounds like a nightmare from reviews. I'll note now that it includes parking, which was one of the major appeals to me and likely other travelers.\n\n Upon arriving, we were greeted by a friendly, but quiet young man at reception. He found our names on a handwritten piece of paper and directed us a couple doors down to our room. The lighting in the whole building is probably the worst part. Very sketchy, old fluorescent lights that are somehow harshly bright and eerily dim at the same time. It's perfect for those of you looking to film a low-budget adult film. The room was somewhat large, with two enormous windows aimed at the back lot. The bathroom was goofy, with 3 toilet paper holders and a small frameless mirror with caulking seeping out the sides. I didn't shower (sorry), but it looked like the most modern part of the room (still a decade old). Should have showered.\n\nWe watched TV for a while, which was fine. The whole place has a slight off smell, which I'd expect at a place of this quality. There was one of those twist top air fresheners in the corner that wasn't doing its job. Do your job, air freshener! As far as cleanliness goes, we were pleasantly surprised to not see a single bug during our stay. Cool! I also lifted the bedsheet to check for bugs, stains, etc. and it looked noticeably clean - probably cleaner than my own mattress. Exhale, I don't think you'll find any bedbugs here. \n\nIt wasn't super loud and we felt relatively secure. It wasn't the most comfortable sleep I've ever had, but it was worth the 60-something USD we paid. It's a fine place to lay your head, but not if you're pretentious about where you stay.

Apparently they freeze the milk with liquid nitrogen, then roll that solid up in white chocolate and coconut.  Put it back in the fridge and serve it up after the milk melts!\n- Beer ice cream, Brownie, and chocolate ganache\n- Mignardises: Chocolate crumble, passion fruit macaroon, peanut butter, chocolate truffle, passion fruit jelly\n\nAll in all, a wonderful meal and wonderful wine pairings.

This was quite possibly one of the better tastings I have *ever* had in terms of flavor, and that's including the likes of French Laundry and Per Se.  \n\nIt's in the bottom floor of a hotel, and we walked up the stairs which were flanked by a pair of Ferrari's and a Bently (somewhat intimidating) to the doorman who let us in.  It's Interesting decor in the main area once you pass reception, kind of a mix between modern (with the huge XO sign) and classic with the enormous faux pillars 'holding up' the overlooking balconies.  \n\nWe had the tasting around 8pm for two and we were 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant -- It was a Sunday, but 3 tables?  Weird, but whatever.  I took a quick look at the menu and noticed that the tasting was not on the menu, not sure if the waiter was going to advertise it as I inquired the moment he came up.  It was surprising it wasn't on there -- but I guess I didn't give him a chance.  Anyway, I immediately asked if I could substitute the fish/seafood dishes, and they were very accommodating and said it was no problem.  \n\nMy first dish (a substitute) was some kind of cured beef (don't recall the name) that was lightly cooked and placed in a broth, awesome -- I have never actually experienced a beef flavor like that.  \n\nNext (a substitute) was veal cheek and some sort of savory onions.  I have never had veal cheek before, and it was very tender and slightly fatty, but not chewy in the slightest.  The onions were a perfect flavor to add to the beef.\n\nMy date had the first two seafood dishes, the first being a trio of different flavored oysters, and the second being escalops of some sort.  She said they were both very delicious, but I cant really comment beyond that.\n\nThird was a pork risotto with thin pieces of pork within the risotto made with pork stock -- absolutely delicious.  Both of us were asking: \"How is risotto really this good?\"\n\nFourth was probably my favorite dish, thinly sliced (filet I think) beef over mashed potatoes and (vidalia I think) onions.  Beef was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes and onions were a perfect match with the beef.\n\nFor the fifth course we added a cheese plate and opted to go with all five cheeses.  All were from Quebec, and all were....Amazing.  The leftovers are in my hotel fridge as we speak, we did not want to waste any of it.  Additionally they had these *very* thinly sliced pieces of toasted bread that came with it.  I inquired, and apparently to get the slices that thin, the freeze the bread before slicing it -- pretty inventive.\n\nThe sixth course was desert, and it was a carrot cake with pineapple glaze and curry ice cream.  I was skeptical of the ice cream, but it all went very well together.\n\nThey finish up with a chocolate dish with nuts of some sort, I only tired a piece, it was pretty good.  \n\nAdditionally, it was our anniversary and they brought out a special flaming parfait type thing with candies at the end, pretty classy.  I only mentioned it in passing when we first talked to the doorman when we got there -- pretty awesome attention to detail. \n\nWe also had the wine pairings for an additional 50$ or so, WELL worth it.  Every pairing was spot on, and they also paired the cheese with a great port for me and an excellent red for my date.  If you come here for the tasting you would have to be crazy not to get the pairing for just another 50$.\n\nAll in all, probably one of the best tastings I have had, especially for that much money.  All in we were at like 350$ before tip, really not that bad for a 3 hour dinner for seven courses with wine pairings + cheese and 3 drinks.  Again, I enjoyed this more than the likes of Per Se, French Laundry (why in the hell do neither of these have wine pairings?!) and others.  It was a great experience and I would certainly go back.  5 Stars hands down.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ay5StmNCKJ7FtrEobQk_HQ"}

Don't mention this restaurant in the same sentence as Per Se, French Laundry, Alinea, or Daniel--I've been to all of them and this place is nowhere near that kind of quality. We had to ask for drinks several times. Our food was awkwardly paced with 10 minute breaks between some dishes and then 2 minute breaks between other dishes. At best, this would be a one-star restaurant in terms of service.\n\nSecond, the food. It was ok. It wasn't great, and it wasn't bad. If I was staying at the St James and just needed a meal without leaving, I'd come here, but with all the alternatives around the neighborhood, forget it. Here's the difference between Per Se and French Laundry--they never repeat a single item on their (larger) tasting menu. In our six course menu, we had some form of curry twice (33% of the dishes), some form of chocolate three times (50% of the dishes), and everything was overly sweet. Each item by itself would have been good, but the point of a tasting menu is that dishes should interact and lead into each other. \n\n\nWould I recommend this place for the food?

Beautiful chandeliers, breathtaking ceiling trims, stunning chandeliers, and grand balconies. One of my criterias when picking a restaurant for my engagement dinner was that it had to be pretty. And being in XO is like being in a sexy, ornate, royal palace. \n\nWe had the tasting menu, and everything was good. To be honest, I did not critique the food as much as I usually do when I eat out, but months later my fiance's cousin still talks about the lamb we had at XO. So yes, I guess the food was excellent. :)\n\nThe service was immaculate from start to end. As soon as we entered through the doors, they took our coats, the cake, any extra bags and stored them away, and we were then led upstairs up the grand staircase to the top level. Our server (can't believe I cant remember his name) was charming, attentive and beyond helpful. He explained everything with a smile on his face, stayed out of the way throughout most of the dinner, but then magically appeared beside you whenever you wanted him. He got us sparklers for our cake, and when the first two pairs fizzled out before we were done taking our pictures, he produced another pair from his pocket with a \"I got extras, just in case\". It's the little things. He was so well-trained, professional, and pleasant to deal with.. One of the best servers we have ever had in Montreal. \n\nIn the end, we wrapped up our celebratory dinner, shared some cake with our server too and took the rest to go. We left very very happy with the evening - everything had gone perfectly, thanks to the expert staff at XO. We were treated like guests in a beautiful royal palace. It was an amazing experience, and XO has garnered a special place in my heart. \n\nJust as we were stepping out the door, our host said \"Goodnight.

Unfortunately, XO tries hard but does not achieve the gold.\n\nAt its core, molecular gastronomy is offering the guest an experience, versus food. The truth is that XO lacks the resources to make this happen. They are using a finite group of people to try to do what New York City or L.A. restaurants do with three times the staff.  The result is that there are problems.\n\nFor example, my salmon was a good piece of salmon. Like most other restaurants today, the salmon was dumped into a sous vide cooker, and was done perfectly. While most restaurants would have crisped the outside in a skillet in order to accomplish a nice golden crust on the fish, the molecular genius decided that this was not necessary. Instead of a crisp fish crust, they would serve perfectly crispy side vegetables to take the place of the crust.  Brilliant!  Except the desired crispness never materialized.  \n\nInstead, I got fish jello.\n\nThe staff wants to do well. Really.  And they are absolutely attentive.  But this kind of dish cannot be accomplished without doubling the kitchen staff.\n\nSimilar stories could be told about every course, for every diner.  My suggestion for the person in charge of creative control is this: it is better to do very little, perfectly, than to be ambitious, but fall short of gold.\n\nFor 450 Canadian you might do better elsewhere.

Never mind picking a few options from the menu - I want the tasting menu with the wine pairings. I want to take out my tie, pocket square and jacket and go fancy. Go somewhere where the initial though is \"Well I can't do this too often\" and the bill at the end of the night reflects that. In the end, the experience is what I am after. Well, last month, I was presented with such a opportunity in one of the most beautiful spots in Montreal.\n\nThe St. James Hotel in the old port is one of Montreal most well known boutique hotel. Located inside the hotel is XO Le Restaurant. A restaurant that certainly makes quite the impression when you walk in. Beautiful high ornate ceilings, chandeliers, Roman columns, beautiful staircases leading to 2 mezzanines overlooking a lounge space and a dining space - it is quite the looker. You can't help but stare around you throughout your time in the restaurant.\n\nFor this evening, at the recommendation of one of my dining companions' friends (who, for the purpose of disclosure here, works in the restaurant and led our service), we were going with their signature 6 course tasting menu with associated wine pairings.\n\nOur first course was thinly sliced Princess scallops with nitrogen frozen oranges and a trio of cauliflower paired with a Niagara Riesling. A precursor of things to come, the presentation was beautiful - the whole dish in a large seashell, sitting on a bed of rocks with dry ice poured underneath by our server. A little over the top with the dry ice? Sure but it added extra flair to the whole proceedings which definitely seemed in line with the setting. The dish itself was quite good - the scallops were perfectly executed, the orange added some zest and the cauliflower a little crunch.\n\nThe second course brought forth Black bass with white beans, parsley puree and a Meyer lemon beurre blanc sauce paired with a glass of Meursault. Another great looking dish that was delicious as well. The fish was cooked perfectly - flaky and moist but with a great skin crispness on top. The beurre blanc brought some richness and had the unmistakable hint of the Meyer lemons.\n\nThe third course was a little richer as we got a Foie gras Tartin with apple ice cider jelly on top, pecan crumble and a apple maple reduction paired with a lovely French Chenin blanc. Just an amazing combination of great technique and great flavours. The fatty foie gras, the sweetness of the apple maple reduction, the beautiful texture of the ice cider jelly and the extremely fine texture of the pecan crumble - there was not a single thing not to like on this plate.\n\nThe fourth course continued along similar lines as the previous one as we got a white truffle risotto with a white chocolate sauce and chestnuts, all paired with a glass of 2007 Barbaresco Paje. This was by far the most filling dish we got on this evening. The white chocolate sauce was a surprise to all of us when it was mentioned but once we tried it, it made perfect sense - a touch of sweetness to offset the inherent creaminess and richness of risotto. The addition of white truffle was wholly unnecessary but oh so perfect.\n\nThe fifth course was Stag with sweet potato done 2 ways and dehydrated Nutella, paired with (appropriately enough) a glass of Stag's leap Petit Syrah. The sweet potatoes, both in puree and galette form, were delicious and the Stag itself was well prepared - very much showcasing the natural gaminess of the meat. The crazy element here was the dehydrated Nutella - such a unique preparation of that item but one that works so well within this dish. The chocolate and hazelnut flavours paired very nicely with the lean meat.\n\nPrior to the final course of dessert, we got a palate cleanser in the form of a Hibiscus tapioca. This was the one dish of the meal that I did not enjoy. It certainly served its purpose as a palate cleanser and it was beautiful to look at but Hibiscus is not a flavour that I enjoy.\n\nThe dessert course itself was a orange flan with fennel ice cream and 3 crumbles: olive oil, black pepper and sea salt. Very unique flavours for a dessert but everything worked very nicely. Great texture to both the ice-cream and the flan. The 3 crumbles were amazing - great flavours without being overbearing. Individually, each worked well with the flan but they also worked well in combination.\n\nAnd to finish off the whole, a small plat including a Mint chip, house caramel and dark chocolate truffle were provided with the checks. All 3 were great - particularly the house caramel.\n \n4 hours after we sat down, we were stuffed - 6 courses and 5 glasses of wine will do that to you. This meal was very much an experience - a pricey one for sure - but an experience nevertheless worth having. The service was impeccable, the decor jaw dropping, the food and wine spot-on. The sticker shock may be hard to get by but believe me - you'll be satisfied in the end.\n\nCheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ay5StmNCKJ7FtrEobQk_HQ"}

Though hubby and I had taken part in similar events in Toronto and New York, but as we were new to the event scene in Montreal (I know, we're late in the game!), we didn't really know what to fully expect.\n\nThere were 3 choices for each course, and XO also gave us amuse bouche and petit fours, kind of making it to 5 courses instead of the standard 3.\n\nThis is what we ordered:\nMe: Squash and Apple Soup / Confit Salmon / Lemon Tart Verrine\nHubby: Antipasti / White Truffle Tagliatelles / \u00c9clair\n\nWe thought that it was pretty surprising that the Confit Salmon was available for an extra cost over the White Truffle Tagliatelles as white truffle is quite expensive. I gotta say, we had to sort of fight over the white truffle dish as we both love the ingredient very much! (We didn't want to order the same thing).\n\nOur amuse bouche was very unique; it was veal tongue with almonds, dried fruit, ricotta cheese? and other ingredients. I hadn't tried a lot of tongue dishes before so I was a little skeptical, while my husband was looking forward to it as he likes tongue. Anyway, overall the textures and flavours were well balanced and it was similar to eating cold foie gras. Both hubby and I liked it and would reorder if it was possible!\n\nMy first appetizer was very delicious. I had initially craved squash soup for awhile so it was a great coincidence when I saw it on the menu at XO! It was served with a Cheese Steak Baguette which was amazing. The sweetness of the apple complemented the squash very well, and the savoury flavours of the cheese steak balanced everything well. Hubby's appetizer was very well presented and again delicious. With tuna, figs, coppa and almond mushrooms, it was definitely a dish that hubby enjoyed very much.\n\nMy main course was good but a little disappointing. Having paid the extra few dollars, it didn't exceed my expectations nor did it have a WOW factor. The visual presentation was very pretty, and when my dish was came out, the waiter poured the warm broth over for fresh flavours. The broth was slightly Asian (I think), and it felt very familiar. The salmon was cooked well but a little too overcooked for my taste, but I did like the mussels and the mango topping for its fresh tastes. On the other hand, my husband's tagliatelles dish was so good! I wished I had ordered it too... anyway, the white truffle was in the sauce of the pasta, and it was so rich in flavour. It was one of our first times having white truffle over the black, and they were distinctly different. There were many different textures as well, such as the cauliflower and bacon which overall enhanced the pasta. Sigh, maybe I will go back before MTL \u00e0 Table ends just for this pasta! (I must be Italian at heart)\n\nMy dessert was very delicious and I was able to end my dinner on a strong note! The citrus tastes of the lemon wasn't overpowering which I very much appreciated, and I think it was because of the yuzu that was used as well. The edible flowers was very pretty and the housemade marshmallow and rosemary used balanced the citrus flavours out. This dessert kind of reminded me of one that I enjoyed at Laloux, maybe that's what I like it so much. My husband's \u00e9clair was delicious as well. It didn't have your average chocolate filling but carrot cream! It definitely didn't taste like any carrot, and it tasted more like a sweet fruit. The dessert was definitely one of the best \u00e9clairs we ever had so far and it was a refreshing change from the more standard chocolate cream filling.\n\nOur last little note of dessert was a chocolate truffle which was really good! Who am I kidding...I'm a sucker for all things sweet. What I liked about this truffle was that it wasn't bitter nor too sweet - it was a perfect balance of flavours while it was dense and rich all at the same time.\n\nOverall, all courses filled us up while it didn't leave us bloated or too full. The quality of food that was presented was overall very high quality and it was a very pleasurable and enjoyable experience. All the servers were very intelligent and friendly, and they also made sure that whatever we needed was available. Compared to the full tasting menu we experienced before, of course there was a difference, but for the price of $41, the 3 dinner course was quite worth it. We were surprised to find that XO isn't a popular place for MTL \u00e0 Table, but we were able to have a enjoyable dinner that wasn't rushed or hurried by anything or anyone. We would highly recommend XO Le Restaurant for MTL \u00e0 Table or for a regular dinner separate from the event. I definitely recommend their tasting menu as it's fabulous and one of the best in Montreal. We had a full 3 hour dinner complete with more than 8 courses!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ay5StmNCKJ7FtrEobQk_HQ"}

Don't waste your time.\n\nDrinks :\nThese were the most bland, flavorless beers I've ever had.  There was a difference between the styles, but not much.  Not worth the water that went into making them.\n\nDecor / Ambiance / Service :\nNowhere else in Quebec City or Montreal did a waiter or bartender try to shame me because I do not speak French.  My partner is fluent and so often I would wait for her to answer rather than ask for the person to speak English, but the guy behind the counter here was so impatient that wasn't possible.  It wasn't busy, it's inexplicable.

Street parking is available [metered] but good luck finding a spot. There are a few car parks scattered about but they'll rip you off.

The clothing is scattered throughout the store and while you have room to move around, don't make any sudden movements or you may hit the person walking behind you. \n\nThe goods: Clothes - mostly womens'. They carry some local designers, which is great, as well as other high-end designers that I know nothing about because you know, I shop at Banana Republic. Anyway, I picked up a pair of Italian leather mittens that are like BUTTER for 60% off. You'll find some footwear, jackets/blazers, dresses, tops etc. They don't carry items in bulk so if you come across something that you like, best jump on it while you can. \n\nService: OK. We were greeted by a friendly clerk when we walked in, and she advised us of their ongoing sale. On my end, I didn't get any service beyond that, but my friend tried on a few items. The clerk who was serving her was nice enough but she was absolutely trying to make a sale. She kept bringing clothes over and insisting that everything looked good when it most certainly did not. A bit much, I thought. \n\nPrice point: Absolutely ridiculously overpriced, but hey - if you've got $600 to spend on a blazer, know yourself out.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8FhSTqMWf3nRh2Ra30_ROg"}

By the time we got ourselves organized and divided into hotel rooms, it was already past dinner time. My mom and I decided to relax a bit before heading out in search of food. Not knowing the area and not having any access to the Internet -- the free wifi in the hotel lobby failed me -- we wandered the streets, not able to make a decision. My mom wasn't too hungry anyway and her stomach had been bothering her. We finally went into this Second Cup and I checked out what they had to offer.\n\nI decided on a chicken caesar wrap that the employee ringing me up kindly warmed up. I also got a bottle of Sprite and a rice crispy treat (mom wanted something sweet).\n\nI asked for a plastic or paper cup so that we could share the soda; the employee informed me that it would cost fifty cents and asked me if I'd like a mug instead. I thanked her and she handed me a large mug -- filled with ice! WHAT?! That's awesome!\n\nThe wrap was good. The chicken was completely shredded, which I thought was odd, but it tasted good nonetheless. It reminded me of rillettes :)\n\nThe rice crispy treat was nice and chewy, and very marshmallowy!\n\nWe sat in the spacious seating area, where people were dining, chatting away, or working on their laptops (free wifi!). If I were in the area on business and needed to work late I'd most likely hit up Second Cup for the 24h convenience, the tasty food, the great service, and the free wifi.

The only other Marriott that I can remember with a few curt interactions was the one in Paris.\nIf you get a room on one of the upper floors, the view out of the semi-circular arched window is good.\nThe room in itself was okay - the bed was comfortable, but the room felt a little small, and the bathroom had a dated look and had just enough room to move about.\nLocation - There is a metro located in the building.\nConcierge - the folks here were extremely nice and helpful.\nThe bar/lounge - The server who attended to us was very nice - a big deal after the otherwise so not $$$ worth stay here.\n \nThe worst part - \nThe complimentary breakfast is a sham! A cup of coffee n a croissant is their continental breakfast! U can't take cereals or fruits instead. If someone is kind enough to let u substitute d croissant for cereals,mind u, only one bowl of cereals. if u take one more of their only available 'small sized cup' of cereals, they dump a $9 on you! \nFor a hotel that charges you $$$, and inspite of being a whatever status here, shame on them for imposing such an unbecoming experience on us! Ruined our day!\nWhat made it worse was the way the duty manager dealt with this episode. We were only one of several displeased folks that morning. The way the duty manager spoke in his patronizing manner with little or no regard to the fact that we just had a very bitter start of the day was very annoying. He had the cheek to tell us that the front desk sometimes gives $10 coupons and that way we would have had to pay $10 less on the bill!! Talk about attitude!!\n(Apparently, as of a day or two before, all Marriotts, atleast those in Canada were informed by the Marriott management that the lounge was to be closed on Sat and Sun and the free continental if applicable was supposed to be limited to just one croissant and a cup of coffee! Wonder if they would object to getting some extra sugar or milk for the coffee! If that is indeed true, well - never expected this from the Marriott group! )\n\n\nUpdate:\nPost communicating the concern, there was a good amount of follow up from the customer service to understand what had happened during our stay.

They seem mature, self-confident, with great personalities. I would believe for most kids this is a great and supportive place to grow up. What happened to my kid was a different experience. The school makes a selection based on the character of the kid - and not on the communication skills as they will tell you. This school doesn't like kids who don't fit the group. And when I say they don't like them, I mean it. My kid was accepted but later on he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. After one year, the director started asking us to change the school. Although we met the teachers regularly, they didn't inform us clearly about the issues with my kid. As the second year began, during a parents day, we went talking with his new instructors. Part of them where really nice and polite persons. When I met the music instructor I smiled to her and introduced myself. Instead of saying hello, her answer was straight away: \"When are you going to remove your kid from the school?\". This is a school instructor speaking this way. Couple of months later, when my kid was already in another school, one day he told me that back at the Face school, there were moments when he was taken from his class and brought to a person who was not the director, nor one of his instructors. He didn't know who the person was but he said it was a lady. He told me the person would start yelling at him, and that would make him start crying. He could not tell me what the person was yelling about, but he only remembered he was so scared he was starting to cry. I never knew about this while he was still at Face, he never told me during that time, probably that shows how painful the experience was.

If I'm not mistaken, FACE had 6 extra hours of curriculum that they dedicate to the arts. By the time a child has gotten to grade 6 at face they already have a solid foundation in both fine arts and music. \n\nAn other fun fact about FACE is that it has both an English section (run by the EMSB) and a French side (run by the CSDM). Interestingly enough, despite being enrolled in the English section of FACE most of my daughters classes are taught in French (No, FACE is not considered either a bilingual school or an immersion school). \n\nConsidering it is such a large school the parent-teacher communication seems relatively good with teachers being available by e-mail and contacting me by phone when issues arise.

I've probably eaten there more than any other restaurant in the city over the years but that probably says even more about their prices than it does their food (but not about its vicinity - it's a bit of a hike north and not too accessible to public transportation). It's not only bring your own wine (and beer), but it's pretty hard to get out of there spending more than 15 bucks per person with tax and tip (including appetizers, main course, nan, etc).\n\nOn the other hand, I'm not sure that I agree with the review below that claims the service is good. In fact, I'd say it's pretty bad. Come to think of it, it's just outright awful. I've waited twenty minutes just to get a menu (having to wildly flag down the server). Even when the places is half-empty, the service is still pretty bad. But if you factor the price in, you can accept it with zen-like serenity.  However, I'd advise that the restaurant is  not only bring your own wine but preferably bring your own wine opener too.  We started bringing ours because we struggled so many times to get the attention of the server to come over and open our bottles.  Once the bottles are open and alcohol is flowing, waiting is less frustrating. In fact, the last time we did that, our waiter ended up borrowing ours. Of course, he disappeared with it and then we had to hunt him down to get it back when we were ready for the next bottle.\n\nBut enough about bottle openers. The Punjab has a fried fish appetizer (damn if I don't forget what it's called) that's spectacular. The only dud is the vindaloo which is not only not spicy but somewhat flavorless.

One of their specialties is called a \"flamm,\" which is more like an Alsatian tart than a pizza. These are pretty good, with mostly local cheeses and fresh ingredients as toppings, and with a thin pastry-like crust. They also make dessert flamms. In addition to flamms they have bistro fare, as well as sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc. We stopped by their Ste-Catherine location for lunch one day and each got a sampler of their beers. Vince got a qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise flamm and their house specialty beer-braised pork shank. I got an order of duck terrine and the mussels proven\u00e7ale. The servings were huge, so it was way too much food. It was all pretty good, but not remarkable. I did like the flamm quite a bit. Service was friendly, and there was a festive sports bar type of atmosphere. I don't feel the need to go again, but it's not bad for some simple, reliable food.

So as far as i'm concern I don't feel the corporate being wrong or an Act. In my opinion the big plus with that place is the fact that there is a solid menu, (Flamm is the best example).  It's one of the nice spot where you can go if you don't know where to go for a beer after work. The food is good price is not that bad since it's not the kind of place you stay for a whole night.

Head to Les Trois Brasseurs.\n\nDespite the premium on downtown floor space, this branch has recently expanded even more to hog up almost the entire ground floor of a building. Even at the busiest times, you are guaranteed a short wait, if at all.\n\nThe music may be a little overwhelming and the menu a little un-navigable, but hang on and you should be impressed.\n\nFirst and foremost, the beers. I think that for such a high-throughput and commercialized establishment (they're a chain, after all) they're awesome. I am a fan of the Brown and Red, but that's just my taste. Given time and a bit of food, I'd have a pitcher to myself gladly.\n\nLet's talk food. Their selling point are the Flamms, which I do not find all that special or worth the money. Bruschetta on matzah kinda describes it. It's a pity they put so much focus on them, when they've got some real great dishes on offer.\n\nTake the burgers, which are very tasty, or their salads, overflowing in their abundance. The real show-stopper and wallet-saver, however, is the pork shank house specialty.\n\nHoly Moses, they must have a pork-friendly cornucopia in the kitchen! The shank is huge, delicious and comes with so many sides you'll struggle to finish them all. Foil-baked potato, sauerkraut, salad and God knows what else.\n\nFor 12 dollars it's a steal. If that's the House specialty, I commend the house and wish it many fruitful years. Caveat emptor, naturally, as once in a blue moon the shank's porky origin could have been quite fat. \n\nThe homebrew beers make this and all other dishes go down like a charm and I never hesitate going to Trois Brasseurs again and again. \n\nYes, the menu is confusing and yes, the variety of foods served can be intimidating.

I was also there with a friend from Cincinnati, taking him on his first Canadian adventure. On our first night, we were on our own and up to our devices for getting dinner. We chose Les 3 Brasseurs mostly because they brewed their own beer. I mean as a beer lover, that is just heaven for me. We got placed at the bar because it was a crowded Friday night. The bartender was very attentive and very beautiful. She was more then happy to speak English. And she pretty much gave us a college level course on their beer selection. We went with two liters of the Amber. I mean we were planning on drinking, might as well go \"balls to the wall\". Along with our beer, we ordered their Poutine. And while I try not to explain food as orgasmic. A plate of their poutine maxi is just that, orgasmic. My friend had the open faced seafood sandwich. And I ordered the Quebec Flammekuchen. Covered in a local cheese,bacon and onion. It was so good. We became friends with a few of our fellow bar sitters. And with the assistant to the bartender, he wasn't a busboy and he was allowed to take orders, just not pour them. Weird? Anyway. We kept ordering beer and shots of Sortilege ( a wonderful maple bourbon that is just amazing). Before we knew it, it was 2am. And we were very well gone. So with a few of our new friends we met at Les 3, we moved to a cheaper drinking hole. And the rest of the night is kinda blurry after that. But I will always eat here when I am in Montreal.

The reason for our choice on this freezing sub zero winters night was simple, it was one of the only places actually open that was serving food. \n\nWhen we arrived it was pretty full with people and resembled a neighbor hood bar where everybody knows your name. There was old time memorabilia on the walls and lots of Canadian sport themed decor including the shirts on the waitstaff. We were seated quick in a small corner along the wall beside the bar with a great view of the kettles inside the on site brewery which was pretty cool to see. \n\n\nFirst, we placed our drink order. Simone had water and I decided on a Sangria ( which is popular in this city for some reason) The menu looked liked an newspaper and was even called The Gazette. I thought this was a nice touch to the ambiance of the place. My drink arrived and was very well balanced in flavor and fruity. \n\n\nFor our appetizer we decided on (of course) Poutine. Although it looked great, when it arrived at the table, I was a bit disappointed in my choice. The fries were not fresh cut, and the gravy was overly salty.  It was still real cheese curds and the dish was okay, but not great. I probably would pass it over next time, as you can find much better Poutine in Montreal ( see my other review for Montreal Poutine).\n\n\nSimone chose for her entree, Chevre Chaud with Greens. This was an open faced sandwich consisting of two slices of French Bread topped with Goat cheese and Tomato Bruschetta, served with a mixed green salad with Herb Dressing. It was good but the Tomatoes were a bit over powered with all the cheese.  Simone was able to finish all of the salad, tomatoes and bread , but had to scrape some of the rich goat cheese off from the dish.\n\n\nMy choice for an entree was the 3 Brassuers Sauerkraut. The dish consisted of a German Bratwurst, a Frankfurt Sausage (AKA-big hot dog) a thick slice of Grilled Ham, Broccoli Crowns, a Boiled Potato and a large portion of Beer Brined Sauerkraut.  I couldn't actually taste a difference between the Hot Dog and The Bratwurst which i found a bit troubling, but both were good. The Grilled Ham was average and the same you could find in any supermarket. The Potato was about as taste less as a potato can be, and the Broccoli was fresh but only luke warm. The absolute star of this dish was the Sauerkraut which i used to top every item on the plate. It was delicious and I wish the rest of the dish measured up.\n\n\nIn addition to my meal, I also tried one of the 3 Brasseurs Micro Brews. I decided on the Blonde Beer. Although the description said fruity and light with a refreshing aftertaste, i didn't find it to be any more or less enjoyable then the bottle of Labatts I have in my fridge. So i guess the moral of this story is that a chain restaurant in Canada is kinda like a chain restaurant in the U.S. The food was average, the beer was average, the ambiance was above average.  Overall, i'll give Les 3 Brasseurs a half-hearted three stars, but if I have a choice I think I'll stick to the independent establishments next time. ***", "type": "review", "business_id": "j_Mfxog4RUlv3J3KSNRWnw"}

I got the 4 beer sampler, but there is also a 6 beer option if you want to try them all. I wasn't blown away by them, but they were consistent and well made. Styles focus more on the Belgian family of beers, rather than the English or American styles. \n\nOverall I liked everything just fine, but it's nothing I'd rush back for. Part of the reason I like brewpubs is that the food and the beer is unique to that one place. I feel like this place is a chain.

Even when it's happy hour, waiting times are never too long.\n\nThe beer itself is good, I like the blonde or the white best- their red has a bitter aftertaste and their stout is just too heavy for me.\nTheir beer cocktails are interesting, you can have them mixed with sprite, grenadine, shot of whisky, lemon liqueur etc. \n\nFood actually kind of sucks. They rarely ever have specials or change their menu, I find it so bland. Their \"pizza\" like dishes are lackluster. They used to have some with chicken as a topping and it was removed from the menu, no clue why as it was the only good one. Crust is too thin, cripsy like a cracker or soft like wet pita depending on the day...\n\nTheir burgers are ok, the beer battered one in particular, but fries are frozen and just so flavorless. They serve everything with that mustard/mayo sauce to mask their lack of flavor.\nThey serve beer battered thick cut fries as an appetizer dish, but you cannot ask for it as a side, instead of regular fries,  the waitress told me they are already individually portioned, so frozen, as a basket appetizer and it would be too much with a burger or anything else I was getting.\n\nThe wraps are a real mess, I've tried their avocado chicken wrap as well as a bbq chicken and it was always steaming hot with a soggy center, mushy pita. Looks like it came straight out of the microwave..\n\nFish and chips another awful mess, fish incredibly oily and soggy.\n\nTheir chicken brochette dish would be the best I had of the bunch but for 14$ the portion is incredibly small. I always like to replace my fries with a side of rice and unfortunately it looks like they only give you 3 spoonfuls. Once, their green beans were undercooked, hard, to the point of being raw.\n\nI don't come here for the food, neither should you, unless you just want a burger or nachos- A couple drinks or place to hang after work is what it's for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j_Mfxog4RUlv3J3KSNRWnw"}

Overall the place was clean and all the staff were very friendly and helpful with any questions we might have had. They have menus in either French or English and all their food items have a symbol of the type of beer they recommend to pair the food with.\n\nOn to the food, I would say it is fairly normal pub food. They have burgers, flat bread pizzas, sandwiches etc... The few items I have had have been good, nothing to complain about but at the same time nothing to write home about. \n\nAs far as the beer I would say it is so-so. Not bad, not really exceptional, especially since is a brew pub. Their recipes are probably developed for a wide audience since they have so many locations, this probably makes the beer just average since they try to appeal to everybody. They only have about 5 beers which they just call by the style they are; I wish they had more. Would be neat if they had the standard beers and then let the brewer design one or two brews just for their location. Maybe they do and I totally missed it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j_Mfxog4RUlv3J3KSNRWnw"}

The most recent time was last night.  It was just my friend and me and it was around 5 PM.  It was the prime time for dinner on one of the busiest streets downtown, on a Thursday.  It was no surprise that when we got there, it was super busy.  \n\nThe terrasse was packed.  There was room for two but the hostess said it would be really tight, so we decided to just enjoy the air conditioning inside instead.  I honestly wonder how many times the women at the front have to say that the customer has to go around to the terrasse side to see if there's room because they don't have communication with one another.   So.. they can speak to the person above them via communication systems but in this tech age, they can't reach someone 20 feet away?  It was odd.  \n\nOther than that, I love their beers (some are odd- if you're not a fan of IPA just stick to what you do enjoy).\n\nThe service has its ups and downs.  I've always had a good experience when our server was male ( and no, it's not just because I'm female).  I've seen some of the females have breakdowns in the middle of service, crashing their dish carts into the glass casings in the middle of the restaurant.  It is really a hit or miss.\n\nThe food however- is good.  It's not amazing but if you're looking for a place to have a quick bite,   I usually get the quesadillas and my friends usually get the nachos or salads....  it's nothing to rave about but for $12, you get what pay for.  I have previously tried the Calamari and was unimpressed.  You don't get very much and you don't have the option of getting a marinara sauce like I enjoy; you automatically get the Teriyaki Horseradish Marmalade.\n\nOverall, it's a decent place to get food- it's just not somewhere that I would rave about.", "type": "review", "business_id": "j_Mfxog4RUlv3J3KSNRWnw"}

New wood paneling, new seats, new tables - gentrification has hit Montreal really hard in recent years and like other cities, everything is starting to look like monotonous and the same, generic skyscrapers, generic condo buildings and generic restaurants and pubs.

Big, sure, but having been at a much better pub the day before, this was like eating leftovers from McDonalds. Service was awful. Don't even get me started on how bad the fries were. I had to slather them in ketchup in order to make them taste somewhat decent. They were greasy, and really chewy. No crunch whatsoever. Could have made better fries at home. \n\nWe barely got any notice from the waitress, partially because there were larger tables filled with business men who occupied most of the time. Either way, it took her forever to take our order, and she barely checked in with us at all. All in all, we could have let it slide if the price was good, but for 2 mixed drinks, a cider, and 2 burgers we paid almost $80. Contrary, we had almost the same food the night before somewhere else, and it was almost half the price. \n\nThe atmosphere was great. They had good music playing, and it felt like the pubs I've come to know and love in the UK. The selection of beer on tap was great.

I ventured over to this spot last night for a quick bite to eat--I was craving spicy salmon rolls like you wouldn't even believe--and I left feeling unsatisfied. Firstly, $6.75 for a spicy salmon roll (with 5 dinky pieces) is really unacceptable. I mean I don't even think it was made fresh and it was not (I repeat, not) spicy in the least bit. Although I must admit the Chicken teriyaki was good--fresh vegetables, delicious sauce--I feel that you could get the same thing at a food court in a mall somewhere. Hell, even 'Teriyaki experience' at Centre Eaton serves up a good teriyaki stir-fry.\n\nThe service was bizarre. The waitress did not speak a word to me--from the moment I  walked in (she motioned me to an open table) to the time I left, it was mostly grunts and head nodding. I usually go out of my way to say 'oh, thanks' or 'how are you,' but it would have been like talking to a brick wall with this one. She was a piece of work. \n\nThe decore is very mundane. Its basically like title flooring with a splash of this nasty blue paint on the walls. The tables are wobbly and the chairs are IKEA. Nothing wrong with IKEA but for $25 for one roll and a teriyaki I expect at least a little effort on presentation. I should've known--if there are only two other diners in the joint at 6 pm its probably not where you want to spend your precious sushi dollars. \n\nEven Sushi Crescent--an AYCE place--was infinitely better in taste, price, and quantity.

The strange:  the class was listed as \"Ashtonga Yoga\", but it had no resemblance to any Ashtonga class I have taken either in the USA or in France.  It started off instead of with the sun salutations with the class sliding across the floor on blankets.  It ended instead of with the finishing sequence with doing a series of core and back exercises using foldable metal chairs.  This seems to be a local specialty because another studio bragged on its web site that it had an excellent collection of chairs for yoga.  Anyways, I would skip this French Canadian Ashtanga and instead go for a run along the river (fantastic) and then head to \"F-Bar\" (1485 Rue Jeanne-Mance, fbar.ca) for a celestial delight of Portuguese-French fusion cuisine (Mackerel, coco beans, almond milk to start and then Halibut black raisins for the main course).  The Ashtanga in Paris and Strasbourg (not to mention Encinitas)  are much better and the run will balance out the calories from dinner and skipping chair yoga will save you back injury so will save you the cost of a massage and balance out the cost of dinner.

I like to try different yoga studios while traveling and sometimes it can be a little intimidating (clique-y, snobbish, no explanations given). Ashtanga Yoga Montreal is the opposite of all that. I was relieved the minute I walked in the door and was warmly greeted by the teacher, Allison, who I later found out is one of the studio directors. \n\nThe space - it's on the 2nd floor in an office building, above a cafe. There are 3 studios, all non-heated. I know hot yoga is all the rage these days, but for those of us who like their yoga room temperature, this place is great. There is a large reception area with room for shoes and coats. The change rooms themselves are very small. There is mat storage available for regulars. You bring your valuables into the studio since there are no lockers. The washrooms are shared and just across the hall. The studio overlooks Rue St. Catherine and have plenty of props and blankets available. The general atmosphere is home-y and cozy, rather than some studios that are going for a more spa-like or modern/minimalist aesthetic. Yoga mats are available for rent and the mat rental is free for your first class (which is $10) or for lunch time classes. \n\nI took a multilevel class with Alison and a level 1-2 class with Tania. Both were led classes, but if you prefer mysore style, they offer that too. Both teachers I had were good. So many studios offer ashtanga-influenced \"flow\" or \"vinyasa\" classes, but I appreciated that these classes were tied closely to the traditional ashtanga style (moving through postures from the primary series mostly). Alison was exception and really went above and beyond when it came to hands on adjustments and useful alignment tips. She also made a point to orient me at the beginning and ask me how the class felt afterwards. A lot of studios seem to ignore you until you become a regular, so it was nice to feel immediately welcome. The multilevel class gave lots of options for beginnings and more advanced practitioners alike. The makeup of the class was diverse -- not just the skinny, bendy, lululemon-clad, Caucasian female stereotype of yoga (nothing wrong with them, of course, but it can add to the intimidation factor for some when everyone is like that!). \n\nPrices are really reasonable and there are student discounts. They also offer different workshops, including acro yoga. Both classes I attended were led in English (with a little French sprinkled in). \n\nThis is a great, no frills place to practice ashtanga yoga. I would recommend it to anyone!", "type": "review", "business_id": "VA_2MctE5uH7Oej61jtAhg"}

I found many comments about this being as good if not better than Schwartz's so we headed out here for our last meal in Montreal for the time being. \n\nI ordered a regular (less peppery) smoked meat sandwich, medium fat on rye, with a side of fries and some coffee. The SO ordered his \"old-fashioned\" but otherwise the same and with a matzo ball soup instead. \n\nThe coffee was fantastic- this is great deli coffee and they're generous with refills. We don't have weak brown water coffee where the refills come only with the check. This ain't no Stumptown roasters but might I say this is a damn fine cup of coffee. \n\nThe matzo ball soup- not so much. It was literally a mushy bland matzo ball in a pool of neon yellow chicken broth made from bouillon. Avoid at all costs, it tastes like a ramen seasoning packet. \n\nNow for the sandwich- it's pretty good! The meat is piled high and served hit which is fantastic for a cold winter day. Unfortunately I don't think I'm sold on Montreal smoked meat. It was like a blander version of pastrami. It doesn't have then complexity and smoke of pastrami, not to mention I wasn't a fan of the bread. I like my rye to taste very much like rye and peppered with seeds. Good bread on a sandwich is half of the sandwich battle in my book. \n\nNow my favorite part is this whole meal was the fries! One thing I love about Canadians is that they know fries- no shoestring crap, no nasty inedible chalk coating, amazing crisp yet tender golden brown fries. Amazing. The perfect texture. \n\nI'd return for some fries and coffee in a heart beat (and excellent service!) but I wouldn't be sad if this is my last MTL smoked meat sandwich ever. Maybe it's the greasy patriotic American inside of me but I'd choose pastrami over MTL smoked meat any day of the week.", "type": "review", "business_id": "S2VTuWT6LnpR_NC1upis6A"}

En bref, mon sandwich \u00e9tait parfait et gouteux comme je l'aime. \n\nL'ambiance? Il s'agit du seul point n\u00e9gatif. N\u00e9ons blafards, d\u00e9cor d\u00e9fraichi, client\u00e8le locale qui vous met un peu mal \u00e0 l'aise (genre groupe de p'tit vieux qui se tait et vous d\u00e9visage \u00e0 votre arriv\u00e9e).

Le service est rapide, mais sans trop de sourire. \n\nEn bref, Deli Snowdon est encore un resto qui offre un bien meilleur sandwich que Schwartz's. Je le dirais donc encore : \u00e9viter les files interminables de ce resto sur St-Laurent qui se pr\u00e9tend \"incontournable\" et venez ici.

The wood fired oven certainly makes the difference between this pizza and other places. Perfect crust, just the right amount of crispyness and actual bread. \n\nThe only thing I wish I would have paid more attention to in the yelp reviews was the size of the pizzas.

I decided to check it out while staying in Montreal recently because it had positive reviews and was also right around the corner from my hotel.  Their delicious, thin-crust pizzas are probably about 10 inches in diameter.  Each one is the perfect size for one person.  Service was very friendly and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is lively--it reminded me of a European cafe.  \n\nAlso, Il Focolaio has the distinction of actually being open for dinner on Sundays, which is slightly uncommon in Montreal.  (Many restaurants close around 4 pm on Sunday.)  So, after wandering around the city for about an hour on a Sunday at 6 pm, not able to find any place to eat, I ended up coming back here for the second night in the row.  Luckily the food is so good that I didn't mind!\n\nBe aware that they have a TON of different pizzas--something like 85 different varieties.  (Most of them are just different combinations of the same toppings, but still.)  The first night I had the Romana (tomatoes, mozzarella, parmesan, basil, oregano, garlic, olive oil), which was great.  The second night I had the Fa Bene (mushrooms, black olives, spinach, mozzarella) which was also good.  I don't really think you can go wrong with anything here, so pick your favorite toppings and enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hg2q5fJNH1c-CYZWT1Sc4g"}

While most of us can tell what is a good pizza and what is a bad pizza, it is the differentiation between good pizzas where people argue. Details like the tang of the tomato sauce, the amount of each ingredient present, thin crust vs. thick crust.... all of these lead to many discussions about which pizza is \"best\". Here in Montreal, we are spoiled with many great options. Personally, I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza and a certain place in Little Italy right now that I won't mention here to avoid direct comparison through this post. I took my girlfriend there and while she enjoyed it, she told me that she preferred her personal spot. And thus, we had no choice but to go to Il Focolaio right by Phillips Square to see how it would rank for me.\n\nOpen since 1984, Il Focolaio does thin crust pizza in a maple wood burning oven. The crazy part about their menu is that they have 75 different pizzas! That is an insane number and frankly one that made me a little scared.... when a menu gets that big, I wonder how many can be truly great. I still kept an open mind and plus it was a beautiful night so we sat on the terrasse with a beer ready to enjoy some pizzas.\n\nGiven we had an friend with us on this Friday night, we tried three pizzas. First up was La Milanese - tomato sauce, artichoke hearts, capicollo, mushrooms, black olives and mozzarella. A nice crispy crust on the underside - the pizza held up to grabbing with one hand. On the flip side, I found the top of the crust to be a little burnt in spots and a little too flaky to my liking. In an ideal world, I want crunch but still chewy once I bit in. All three pizzas were the same so they are consistent with the cooking in the oven. In this instance, I suppose it is more a matter of personal taste. Each pizza is about 12 inches so a solid size as a personal pizza. Plenty of ingredients as well which cover the entirety of the pizza. This particular mix of ingredients wasn't my favourite - I liked the fatty capicollo and the mozzarella but I've never found artichokes and mushrooms very enjoyable on a pizza especially if they are rough cut as they were. I also hate olives - I guess you can tell by now this wasn't my choice - which didn't help.\n\nOur second pizza was the Spinarto - Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, artichokes, mozzarella and olives. This one - again not my choice... darn olives! - was more enjoyable to me. The garlic and spinach worked well and somehow helped to make the artichokes less noticeable to me.\n\nFinally we get to my choice, the Renaissance - Tomato sauce, spinach, garlic, olives, mozzarella and spicy pancetta... without the olives of course! The extra kick of the pancetta gave this pizza more bite compared to the more vegetarian pizzas we had before. Also the cheese was a little bit more golden on the top than the previous ones which provided a little different flavour and texture. Pretty enjoyable to me.\n\nLastly, while Il Focolaio doesn't have many things on the menu other than pizzas, they do have Sicilian cannolis which I can never say no to! Solid crunchy shell with a nice creamy filling, these were a solid way to finish off the meal.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed Il Focolaio but its pizza didn't blow me away. It's definitely the best one in the downtown core I've tried so but left me firmly believing in my own personal favourite at the moment. My girlfriend didn't succeed in swaying me which means that pizza will remain a point of contention between the two of us. Guess we will just have to alternate between spots for a while if we want harmony to remain!\n\nCheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "hg2q5fJNH1c-CYZWT1Sc4g"}

I had lunch here last week and the place was jam-packed. With a menu which has nearly 90 different pizzas, you're bound to find one you like. Plus it's all made in a  wood-burning oven in the back, rendering the crusts, to be super thin, crispy, and yet substantial enough to hold all toppings. Plus the dough doesn't fill you up to much and to quickly preventing you from enjoying your toppings.\nFrom what I understand, this is pretty close to Neapolitan standards of pizza (Naples is the real home of pizza in Italy) and pretty much all the toppings are those you'd find in Italy but there were a few toppings which I do wished were offered even if they aren't Italian. I love Mexicana pizza so unfortunately there were no hot peppers or ground beef. I was also surprised that there was no granita or tiramisu for dessert, but that's just being nitpicky.\nYou really cannot go wrong coming here for lunch sometime.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hg2q5fJNH1c-CYZWT1Sc4g"}

This place is 5 stars for people watching, 3.5 stars for the food and 3 stars for the service. \n\nWe opted to sit outside on a beautiful evening. Outdoor real estate is hard to find in any big city and here you get crammed into a sardine-box of outdoor seating. The table is bolted to the floor and there was a pregnant woman sitting behind me so I couldn't exactly ask her to scoot her chair in. The night we were here there was also an epidemic of bees and rather than target one of the floral frocks around us the bee stung my husband.\n\nWe kept it simple. Italian salad and a sausage, mushroom and green pepper pizza. Kudos to them for spitting both and bringing them on separate plates sparing us the hassle.   \n\nThe salad was plain, but tasty in its own simple way. The pizza crust was thin, but the toppings a little heavy making it almost necessary to use a fork and knife. Also simple and good.  \n\nService was slow. I like cozy but this was a little too cozy. Especially when people treated it like an international airport bringing all their luggage in tow causing a spectacle as they try to drag their backpacks, huge purses, and shopping bags in and out.\n\nPeople watching was excellent and because we were so close we also had the treat of the audio to go along with it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "hg2q5fJNH1c-CYZWT1Sc4g"}

I was on tour with a Senegalese band, traveling around the Great Lakes.  I had a day free in Montreal so I asked the concierge what I absolutely could not miss seeing while in town.  She tells me that there's an church in \"Old Montreal\" that I have to see.\n\nI got up early and went out for cereal.  Cereal in Canada is not as sweet as cereal in the US, in case you were wondering.  After breakfast I start to walk down toward Old Montreal, which has a bunch of docks.  I cannot find this church.  I ask a family about to get on a boat \"ou est la cathedral de (whatever the name of the church was)?\"  They ask if I'm American, tell me the church is just a few docks away and suggest I get on the boat and they'll take me there.\n\nNow normally I wouldn't get on a stranger's boat but I think, they're  not going to murder me with their kids there so I get on.  They give me half a sandwich.  I explain why I'm there, etc.  I start to realize that Montreal is bigger than I thought.  They drop me off, explain how to get to the church and invite me to their house for dinner.  I thank them.\n\nThey dropped me off at the wrong place.  I somehow ended up at the Molson factory, no church in sight.  This is not the fault of my French.  I'm not sure how this occurred.  I ask some men standing outside in Molson jackets if they know where the church is.  They say they don't.  That's fine.  Now I want a tour of the Molson factory, even though it is offensively stinky outside.  I ask for a tour and they told me either they don't have tours on Sundays or they didn't do tours at all.  I say please.  They say \"non.\"  I say pleeeease.  They say \"non.\"\n\nSo then I'm getting a tour of the Molson factory.  It is even stinkier than I expected; blah blah blah fermentation.  Because they're not supposed to let anyone in, I didn't get to see much.  Maybe the official tour is more interesting.  I ask the guys where I can find poutine, an item that everyone told me I should try and they tell me about a little cafe up the road about a mile.  I don't remember its name.\n\nI walk to the cafe and order some poutine and a beer.  At this point, my roommate Omar (who I was traveling with) calls and asks where I am because he wants to go out for lunch.  I pause.  I say \"actually, I'm not even sure I'm in Montreal anymore.  But don't worry, I'll find my way back.\"  He does not let this go.  I suppose it would look bad if he came with me and 15 Senegalese men to Quebec and came back without me.  I ask the waiter where I am and he says \"pres de le parc d'attractions!\"  \n\n\"Quel parc d'attractions!?\" j'ai demande.\n\nTurns out the waiter got off in another hour.  I drink two more beers.  He has a monthly pass and we walk across a really beautiful bridge to the amusement park.  We get halfway across the bridge and he starts to reconsider.  It looks like it's going to rain.  In the story I tell my friends, I went the amusement park with the guy because they would think it's crazy that I went by myself, but I did.\n\nWhat is this a review for again?\n\nOh, right.  \n\nSo La Ronde.  Well, when it rains you slip all over the place if you're in flip flops.  I had to walk barefoot all day.  I couldn't believe it was a Six Flags because everything there seemed very pared down.  The roller coasters that I've been on a Six Flags parks in the US are much bigger.  Lots of annoying American kids, but I guess you find that at any amusement park near America.  Nothing amazing, but if you're in Montreal and regular site seeing isn't doing it for you it's not a bad idea.  Tickets ran around $45.\n\nMy hotel ended up being about 9 km away.  I wish I could review the cab service because it was only $10 or so to get me all the way back there.\n\nBy the way, does anyone know where that church is?", "type": "review", "business_id": "qfNuXG0254-YGBIy2_SqCQ"}

If you are a coaster enthusiast, then definitely check it out, though I warn that it is definitely not worth the $35+ entry fee alone.  The wooden Monstre is pretty cool as well; too bad I didn't get to ride it a second time because it broke down shortly after.\nLittle did I know that this would be an ongoing theme.\nI've been to plenty of amusement parks before and know that this is the name of the game.  Shit breaks down, operators don't know anything about it so they have to call and wait for the mechanic, and you have to move on to something else for a while and come back later.  But really, we barely got to go on most of the thrill rides here that we wanted to because they were all broken down at various points in the day or appeared to be completely closed (including the other coasters, Vampire and Cobra).  Thus, the other more lame rides had longer lines that didn't feel worth it since we barely wanted to go on them in the first place.\n\nAlso, the operators didn't seem to know how to run the lines fairly.  They often offered a single-rider line, with the incentive that you will be able to load more quickly than you would while waiting to fit your entire group.  However, the employee would often ignore the single line entirely and just pick people out of the other line, so we would be stuck there without the line moving at all.

Islands are meant to trap, and it seems that La Ronde takes full advantage of this fact and then some. Many of the roller coasters are placed on the periphery, where their extremes put you tantalizingly close to the bridges leading back to safety, the extraction \"ponts.\"\n\nUpon arrival we studied the signs carefully. While we were on vacation, we were still mere mortals and needed to remain budget-conscious. $45 was on the high-end, but doable. We had come this far, needing excitement, food, and a place to pee in whichever order we could find. Two of us stepped to the ticket windows, handing over credit cards to their respective tellers. \"That'll be $51,\" said one. We were taken aback. Had the prices suddenly jumped $6 in a few mere minutes? Had the greedy hand of Le Man again wrapped his chapped, demin-gloved hand around our dangling seed packs? Regardless, this was six dollars too far. The first of our group declined and requested a moment to reconsider. However, the other teller had not been as forthcoming and had already swiped for payment. No refunds.\n\nWe spitefully followed suit, and moments later walked to the gates with four over-priced slips of paper. We were determined to get our money's worth. What comes next would not be best served as a narrative, but as a presentation of evidence to you, the jury, in order to prove beyond a reasonable doubt La Ronde's guilt in a \"merde most foul.\"\n\nExhibit A: The food court. If one follows the natural path leading into the court, you are first presented with the apparent crown jewel of French-Canadian cuisine: Indian buffet. If you are able to resist these immediate, low-hanging treasures, you are rewarded with a bevvy of exotic tastes such as \"Subway,\" and \"Dippin' Dots.\" We decided to continue our self-imposed experiment of \"How Much Poutine Does It Take to Kill A Man?\" Thankfully, the prices were roughly equal to the food offerings outside the park. Equal in the sense that a severed kidney rolled in paste and glitter is equal to a Faberge Egg.\n\nExhibit C: The Rides. In all honesty, I may be mistaken on this, but if I am, it's only because it's my first time in an amusement park that leaves numerous rides unattended and shut down on weekends in order to create a sort of meta-labyrinth of urban decay. Luckily, the coasters were open (sort of--explained later), and that's all we cared about.\n     Exhibit C-1: Le Monstre: Supposedly one of the biggest wooden coasters in America. Unfortunately, no one cares about size when it comes to wooden coasters. If they did, you could save a lot of money and falls down a redwood tree. Wooden coasters are all about a balance between feeling like you're going to die and actually dying. But I'm from NYC, so maybe The Cyclone has spoiled me. \n     Exhibit C-2: Ednor-L'attaque: A deeply thematic coaster that warms you up by making your queue snake through a short introductory rip-off of Indiana Jones, then chills you to the bone by making you spend another hour listening to Katy Perry as you watch weeping pre-teens forced to shamefully walk past you towards the exit. If you're still able to handle the terror when you board the ride, you're treated to a terrifying explosion of water that hits no one from two spouts that may or may not be aimed in the general direction of the ride. Also, it's 40 seconds long and takes over 2 minutes to exchange riders.\n     Exhibit C-3: Goliath: This coaster earns La Ronde the only star keeping it in positive numbers. The decently-long ride, high-capacity, and exciting drops make this the worthwhile and redeeming aspect of the entire park. Much like the warm towel left on your face in between waterboardings. \n     Exhibit C-4: The Cobra: It's hard to talk about this ride without falling into a blank-stare trance, not unlike a Vietnam vet. I cannot ever recommend this ride in good conscious. However, a near-perfect simulacrum can be had by standing in place for two hours, duct taping yourself to a wall (standing up), then have one friend violently shake your head while another repeatedly uppercuts you in the balls. \n\nWe could take no more. We were broken souls. I'm also running out of room. I leave you with two key points:\n1) The same Island held POW camps during WWII. Officially they were shut down. Unofficially, they were renamed \"La Ronde.\"\n2) The Island is man-made from several smaller islands. It is, according to nature, not supposed to exist.\n\nIn other words: Liberate tutemae ex inferis.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qfNuXG0254-YGBIy2_SqCQ"}

The ticket prices (~$50) were so much cheaper than what I was used to in Florida at Disney and Universal (~$90) that it seemed like a bargain.\n\nAnd they had a ton of Roller Coasters! I'm a coaster junkie, so this was awesome. We got to the park around noon, and had plenty of time to ride all the coasters and a couple of other small rides before it closed. \n\nI think Vampire was my favorite, although there was a problem with it while we were standing in line, and we frustratingly watched several coasters go by with no one riding them.\n\nLe Monster was in fact a monster wooden coaster - and there are two tracks you can ride. There's two lines too. We tried to be smart and get in the line with less people in it, but we soon realized that our side was operating only one train at a time, while the other side had two going, and moved twice as fast as our line. \n\nThere was another coaster - Le Cobra, and it was just awful. It jerked your head around so much that everyone we got off with was complaining of headaches. They need better head rests or something, it was redic. \n\nGoliath was a crazy coaster, like a wave - up and down over and over again, with one turn at the end to send you back. \n\nEdnor (the lochness monster?) Was a quick but fun coaster, with lots of sharp turns and inversions. It reminded me of the dueling dragons coaster at Universal in Orlando. \n\nWe had a lot of junk food - beignets and poutine - at La Ronde, but nothing was incredibly memorable. Oh yeah! We weren't allowed to ride the carousel because we didn't have any kids with us - uncool! \n\nIt was mostly a really fun day though.

Going in autumn has it's perks, an atmosphere a little more relaxed and cooler air than in summer. Still, crowds are many since the park is only open on weekends in the autumn. My friends and I had been planning to do this for weeks now and managed to catch a good day to go which presented a forecast of clouds but no rain which is perfectly fine. \n\nWe showed up about a half an hour past opening time and crowds were big but not too overwhelming either. At this time, everything is Halloween-themed and the employees dress up quite creatively. We made our way quickly to Le Monstre where the wait was not bad at all. It felt good to feel the rush and energy of a roller coaster after four years of not being on one. I'd like to these things every year! We would have gone on the coasters a second time but we were concerned about wait times since more and more people came as the day moved forward. We moved on to Goliath and had one hell of a time there as well. The drop was exhilarating. Vampire proved exciting and amazing as well while Cobra had many good things about it but wasn't quite as thrilling as the others. Unfortunately, the last coaster we wanted to go on had a 2 hour wait and the general consensus was in favor of not waiting since everyone was pretty worn out after the fourth coaster in addition to all the walking and standing. We weren't generally interested in the smaller rides either though I wouldn't have minded a few of them. Organization and getting on and off the coasters was not hectic and went smoothly. We were 6 and being an even number is a gift. The chill and jitters after a roller coaster ride on an autumn day is well worth it!  \n\nNow, onto the food. Like anywhere else, food prices are outrageously expensive. Five dollars for a slice of crappy pizza from Pizza Pizza and eighteen dollars for a foot-long sandwich at Subway with a drink and cookies. Bring your own food if you really hate the idea of not only eating the park food but paying too much as well! Good luck sneaking it in. The first two coasters made us pretty hungry so we had to stop and pay the price. Before we called it a day, my friends wanted to go to a crepe shop we had passed. Be warned: However much you may like crepes, skip this and go somewhere outside the park for crepes that is not only cheaper, but doesn't take a millennium to prepare your order. Come on, this is Montreal! You can do better than La Ronde. Same with Poutine. This place was ridiculous; one person taking orders and making the crepes, according to my friend. We waited and waited..nearly forty minutes or maybe more. It's just not worth it. We could have gone on another ride instead before leaving. \n\nIn conclusion, I had a really great time here and I will be back for that one coaster that we missed! I may just buy a season pass since it's only ten dollars more than a regular one-time admission ticket and gives you unlimited access to the park with a few other benefits as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "qfNuXG0254-YGBIy2_SqCQ"}

For this reason, we went a second time to make use of it.\n- Given that La Ronde is a fairly small park, it's pretty easy to navigate.\n- Rides worth mentioning: Vampire (I went 4 times), Cobra, Manitou, Vertigo, Bumper Cars, Demon, and a few others whose names I can't recall.\n- Both of our visits occurred on overcast, drizzly weekdays. This is the best time to go - lines were generally nonexistent. \n- Some staff members were very pleasant.\n\nCons:\n\n- Traveling through Montreal to get to the park was a nightmare.\n- Ridiculously expensive to get in (parking and tickets) and to eat - just like every other amusement park in existence. \n- Many of the rides are really showing their age, and a significant number of attractions were shut down - some even seemed abandoned.\n- A few rides cost extra - we tried the Slingshot, which was $20 per person. It was fun, but not worth that much money. The Go-Karts were also extra but they were closed.\n- Rides not worth waiting in line for if you're an adult: Dragon.\n- As others have mentioned, La Ronde simply isn't designed to handle large crowds the way Wonderland is; therefore, you might end up waiting a while.\n- Some staff members seemed like they hated life.\n\n\nAs always, if you're going to head to any amusement park, I'd recommend taking the whole day to really get your money's worth.

I'm tempted to say there's too much hops but my beer snob friends tell me there's no such thing as \"too much hops.\"  In any case, what I do know is that there are far better brewpubs in town that aren't chains and don't have the artificial ambience of an airport bar.

I had the la blonde and Etienne had the la brune. Both were good (tasted like beer, yo). For lunch, I had the \"La Sp\u00e9ciale Brasseur\" pizza (onions, mushrooms, bacon and gruyere cheese) and Etienne had La choucroute 3 Brasseurs (Smoked sausage, frankfurter, grilled ham and potato with sauerkraut). Both were good. My pizza was tasty, but the crust was NOT as crunchy as it looked on the menu. The edges had a bit of crunch but the middle was super mushy. It had good flavor though. I loved my husband's smoked sausage. But I tend to LOVE sausage and beer together. \n\nI was wondering while we were sitting there in the restaurant... how many stars would I give this place? Compared to other Sainte Catherine Street eateries, it's about par with Reuben's, and that Italian restaurant (Angela & Vito's?)... other higher-end chains.

A review on Yelp tells me where to go in new cities. If I could pay $5 to get 4 or 5 stars instead of 1 or 2 for bad service, I would take the hit any day. People pay hundreds of dollars for advertising, but $5 here and there is worth its worth in advertising gold. We pretty much ignore any restaurant under 3 1/2 stars.\n\nThe place was inviting for a touristy brew pub, everyone inside seemed happy. The beer was pretty cheap during happy hour.\n\nMr. Kalenborn was in post 10 mile walking paradise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EuRTuzFXKFLe6Hs_VsXSVw"}

It was definitively our student hangout place, so there's a lot of memory in this place for me, my first beer at 10 am.. :)\n\nNow on with the actual review, Trois Brasseurs is known to brew their own beer. The beer is actually good as an introduction to non-industrial beer but as soon as your taste in beer develop it becomes generic; however generic doesn't mean not good. Their amber beer is the one I get when I go there and definitively their British beer cocktail tastes great and pack quite a punch. It is possible to order a meter of beer which is about 8 (I think not sure) half-pint and it comes with a free lunch.\n\nFor the actual food, you will eat fine at this place, it will not be the greatest meal you have experienced, but for the atmosphere there is at this place it's definitively worth it. If I compare with the 3 brasseurs I went to in Reims, the food is less good than the one in France but the menu aren't the same at all. I suggest you go with a burger or flamkueche. Last time I tried the 3 Brasseurs Poutine, it was really good however, I think I gain 3 lbs after eating this it contains a lot of thing and fat (and that was expected, I'm not ordering poutine for their healthy value ;) ).\n\nThe Atmosphere is like the one in a sport bar, so it's a great place to go with a group of friend during the evening/night you will definitively have a good time there, it doesn't get too noisy so you will be able to hear everyone speak without yelling. For lunch it's quite a nice place also their lunch menu doesn't cost a lot and is quite decent.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EuRTuzFXKFLe6Hs_VsXSVw"}

I am sooooo glad that it was the former. \n\nAfter a day of looking at Canadian and worldly art, this bar/restaurant was a much needed delight. First, the bar has an AMAZING selection of craft beers and brews, and interesting cocktails. Also, it has some kind of weird drinks where they pair various beers with frozen drinks. Think of a blonde ale mixed with a pina colada. . . if that is your type of thing.  Although I really did not care for these beverages (because they were too sweet for my taste buds), many people who dislike beers may appreciate these beverages. Hell when in Montreal . . . \n\nSecond, the staff (especially Anna, the bartender) is WONDERFUL. Anna was very FUN and ENTERTAINING. Plus she always made sure that our drinks were filled to the brim. She (not dissing the other staff) probably was the main reason that we had so much fun at Les 3 Brasseurs. The barback girl and manager also were very good. \n\nThird, the bar space is very open (like many places in Montreal). It is nice to chill at bar where you are not all on top of each other. Sometimes, you just want to drink without having someone all up in your sh*t. \n\nThe one drawback is that Canada, like many places in the world, serve exact pours. So, if you want a Bourbon neat, you may have to order 3 at the same time to get a decent drink/buzz. \n\nAll in all: the next time that I visit Montreal, I will make another trip here. Hell, I may do it without going to the museum. Maybe next time I will even try some of Les 3 Brasseurs' food because on this occassion this more of a drink your calories type of day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EuRTuzFXKFLe6Hs_VsXSVw"}

Of the two people at the hotel check in desk, one was friendly and one was extremely rude. And I mean extremely. No smile, very unwelcoming, made myself and the group checking in in front of me feel unwanted at the hotel. \n\nThe vending machine on my floor (2) looked like it had been installed in 1960 and was out of Diet Soda of any kind, so I was forced to venture downstairs to the bar where I was charged an extortionate price of more than $3 each for a small glass bottle of Diet Coke. This was after having to wait in line at the bar for upwards of 10 minutes as the bar was severely understaffed. I feel I should not have had to go downstairs for a coke at midnight when I checked in had the hotel been able to provide a decent standard of room service -- but apparently the room service closes when the restaurant kitchen closes, which is far too early. And breakfast is not served until 6.30am, which is too late for many of us traveling to the airport. \n\nRegarding the airport shuttles -- though free, it was severely overcrowded and there were more people in the van than seatbelts. This is not only dangerous and uncomfortable, but illegal, as well. The shuttles also seem to leave 5 minutes before it was scheduled. I was meant to catch the 6am shuttle and when I arrived at the front desk at 5.55am I was told it had left already. When I asked if there was room on the 6.15am shuttle the man at the desk was not able to tell me, even after radioing the shuttle driver. Nobody seemed to have a list of people meant to be on the shuttle and so I was just informed to \"wait and see\". After waiting it turned out there was room on the shuttle (though illegally crammed in like sardines), but then this shuttle left at 6.10am by the clock in the van itself. So why call it the 6.15 shuttle? \n\nThere was also no porter/bellboy service to speak of, and I arrived with 4 heavy suitcases that I was left to struggle with on my own. It would have been very nice if someone could have stepped in to help. \n\nThe toothbrush I was given at reception when I asked for one was of the sort that bends nearly in half when used. It looked like the kind airplanes give you that has about 2 bristles and is made out of plastic 1/16\" thick. It would have been nice to be given a proper toothbrush that I could have really cleaned my teeth with. \n\nWhen I went to log on to the wi-fi that was apparently free with my room, the computer prompted me for my room number and surname. Having provided both it then told me that my name did not match the files of the hotel and it was unable to provide me with internet access. As it was already late at this point and I just wanted to check last minute flight details I chose to forgo bringing this to the hotel staff attention and just gave up on it. By why advertise it as free if it's not? \n\nAs far as the room goes -- the bathroom had conditioner, body wash, a bar of soap, and puzzlingly no shampoo. Was I meant to condition my hair but not wash it!? I also found many hairs in the bathroom that were not mine. What really took the cake, however, were the two MICE that I saw while tucked up in bed reading before sleep. One running around the floor under my bed and one on the dresser next to the television. Never in my entire life have I stayed in a hotel that has mice in it -- and I never plan on doing so again as I will NOT be back here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2XETsVwIVxBt_S1Gp0o3LA"}

Though the choices were few, there was a movie theater, a mall, and a few restaurants that we could visit with their (other) free shuttle service.\n\nI asked the front desk for change so I could tip the airport shuttle driver and was told that they could do that but that they would keep 10%. I was in a hurry and just assumed it was USD to CAD conversion. Of course it wasn't anywhere near that.\n\nThe shuttle driver was friendly enough but drove like he was on a race track. We were having to hold on pretty tight to make sure we didn't get knocked around in the back of the van.\n\nThe next morning...\n\nI went in to brush my teeth and turned on the hot water as I would anywhere and let it run for a couple of seconds before testing it out. Normally it  either would have been just right or maybe a little warmer than I like. This water was SCALDING HOT. I put my hand under it for an an instant and pulled it back out quickly screaming expletives that I won't repeat here. Even after running my hand under cold water for a while it still felt like I had done some pretty good damage to a couple of my fingers.\n\nThen we headed downstairs to get some breakfast at their in-hotel restaurant called Volare. The buffet looked busy so we decided to give it a try. It was the usual fare: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, French toast, pastries, cereal, etc.\n\nI'm used to eggs being either powdered which has an different taste than fresh but these tasted \"grainy\" and I didn't have much of that. The French toast was tasty and we ate more of that than anything. The finale had to be the milk. My fianc\u00e9e had gotten herself a bowl of cereal and 2% milk. The milk came out of the container curdled. When I showed it to the waiter they quickly removed all the cartons from the buffet and threw them out muttering something about a refrigerator that isn't being kept cold enough.\n\nThe shop downstairs was closed at 8:45am so we had to get change (again, at a huge markup) so that we could get a soda from one of the vending machines. As another reviewer mentioned, this machine looked like it was from many many years ago. And a *can* of soda was $2.\n\nIf the stay hadn't been free I would have gotten my money back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2XETsVwIVxBt_S1Gp0o3LA"}

I was attending a wedding and decided to book a room since there was an open bar. I'm reviewing my stay at the hotel and not the banquet part of this location which was way superior.  \n\nThe lobby is clean and well kept but looks outdated. The rooms were nice looking and the bed was comfy.  Unfortunately the walls are paper thin and our bathroom door was broken. Once closed you had to pull on the handle with tremendous efforts to get it to open again...the boyfriend had a mild heart attack thinking he was stuck there. I laughed at the rubber mat they left rolled up in the corner of the tub. So 80's and unwelcoming; these things attract bacteria and mildew like there's no tomorrow. I fully understood why they had when I took a shower; the tub was extremely slippery! Keeping with the restroom theme, the shampoo and conditioner were simply one of the worst I've used. The product inside itself isn't bad. They're supplied by bath and body works and to be fair my hair felt and looked nice afterwards. The problem is in the bottle themselves. It's ridiculously hard to get the product out of there. You get one good gulp and then nothing, so much waste. \n\nMoving on to the service part of my stay. We were welcomed by a male employee who was courteous but had very visible tattoos on his hands. Call me old fashioned but it threw me off a little bit, like a mismatch between the look of the employee and the setting. They took a deposit on my credit card without warning me. Although it was corrected at check out I would have appreciated them telling me rather than my credit company sending me an email alert for the latest transactions and finding it out from there. \n\nI can understand why people chose to come here as it is not too far from the airport but for the price I think the Hilton Garden Inn is much nicer and has better service. The only 2 parts that I could give 5 stars are the pool and the banquet hall. The pool is perfect if you're travelling with kids, it has this huge water slide that will keep them entertain. As a montrealer I think you can book the pool for events or kids birthday party. The banquet hall was stellar! The food was delicious and the rooms were beautiful as well maintained. I'm guessing this location is a tad more into wedding business than the hotel business.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2XETsVwIVxBt_S1Gp0o3LA"}

It felt like the waiters were doing us a favour by serving us.\n\n We ordered our food and had to wait an extremely long time. When the food arrived, it was mediocre at best.  The risotto was bland, and the rest of the food was under-seasoned, and not well portioned.   Water and drinks were slow to arrive.  When the first diner requested her bill, she was rudely told 'this is the last time you'll get individual bills!'.  Puzzled, I expressed  my shock at the waiter's rudeness.  The waiter retorted that he was not rude madame... (thus proving his rudeness).\n\nBills were very slow to arrive. It turned out that the rude waiter was in fact the manager (perhaps the owner)  of the restaurant!\n\nThe mood in the hot and clammy restaurant was unfortunately very misogynistic.  We were a group of 40 female professionals, along with a couple of male colleagues.  Had we been a group of 40 male professionals, this sort of treatment would surely not have occurred.   When I left, the rude server thanked me and told me to have a nice day.  When I told him there was no need to thank me as I did not enjoy my meal and I would not be returning, he followed me on to the street and continued to justify his rude behaviour.  Very unbecoming...an atrociously failed attempt at proper customer service.\n\nOverall, I am not only disappointed, but disgusted by the the experience my colleagues and I had at this restaurant.  40 women could have recommenced this restaurant to friends and family, but instead we will tell them to STAY AWAY!", "type": "review", "business_id": "bbGMmchhCeaPMSKLgDrWdA"}

Trust me, it's not the same as the crap we get here. They also have a counter filled with ready-to-go items. The other half of their space is dedicated to the restaurant where there are just a few tables (maybe 10), however they do offer up two terrasses - one on Sherbrooke and one on Draper. Perfect for a summer day.\n\nThe food: The menu is fairly varied - you select your pasta and sauce, then you eat your heart out. Now, I should point out that one portion of the menu offers up store bought pasta like ravioli, while the other boasts homemade pasta. The price difference between the two is very minor so ordering the fresh stuff doesn't break the bank. On my end, I had no room for appetizers so I went straight for the Primi - homemade Fettuccine with a Bolognese sauce. I found the pasta to be cooked al dente, exactly the way I like it. I enjoyed the texture and the taste and the only down side was that the pasta was a little sticky. I enjoyed the sauce very much - it wasn't acidic at all (i.e. not too tomatoey), it was meaty enough and it tasted great. Maybe lacking a tiny bit of flavor, but nothing to dissuade me from ordering it again. My date ordered the ravioli with Arrabiata sauce and she enjoyed her meal as well. \n\nService: It was OK. Not fantastic, but OK. The wait staff seemed a little indifferent and rushed even though the place wasn't full.

I'll go back to find out if they deserve that fourth one, though, because it was pretty tasty.\n\nI had a traditional striploin steak and fries with mushroom sauce. It was good, although I asked for it rare and it was definitely medium. My cousin sitting next to me asked for it medium and it was definitely well done. Tasted good, though. To start I had the sardine pat\u00e9 which was tasty as well.\n\nThis place is BYOB only, which is cool with me 'cus we drank top-notch wines without paying the keystone vino markup.\n\nWhere they fell short was on the service and overall experience. To give them credit, it was an incredibly busy night, but I'm of the opinion that a top level restaurant should staff properly and accommodate the guests it seats without compromising any aspect. Anyway, we went here with a party of 10 on December 22nd and it was packed full of other parties just like ours. Considering how crowded it was, the staff did ok, but they were definitely understaffed - like 3 servers for about 100 diners. They became flustered and service started to falter. For example, one of the young kids at our table spilled a glass of water and the waiter didn't re-set the table until we requested he do so. When he did 're-set' it, he only replaced the paper on top of the linen table cloth, so it immediately soaked through and was wet again. Other details were missed consistently throughout the night as well.\n\nGood food, decent service, unable to handle the busy holiday season, worth and try and another try.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Za0-WAUs879y8Yd30H3P4A"}

Especially in Montreal where outside of a few well-known ones, it is a somewhat barren wasteland - mostly in terms of the quality of the meal itself. It is nice to save on the alcohol cost but if the meal is not up to standards, I would rather pay the premium elsewhere. After a long weekend course, I was invited to a dinner with my family at a portuguese BYOW near the Atwater market that I had never noticed before, Bitoque.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, the space is nice and functional. Thankfully Bitoque stays away from the kitschy look can see in some \"traditional\" Portuguese restaurants. Cream-colored walls with nice artwork all around the room, banquets, wooden chairs and honest-to-goodness white tablecloths. On a busy Saturday as it was, the room was rather noisy but not overbearing. My one issues was that the tables were rather close together so when the room is fully occupied as it was, there really isn't much room to move or even sit slightly away from your table.\n\nBitoque offers both a standard \"a la carte\" menu as well as a tapas menu. For this particular evening, we stuck to the tapas offering. First up, past\u00e9is de bacalhau - fresh cod croquettes on wakame salad and cilantro a\u00efoli. I could leave the salad underneath but the cod croquettes had the right exterior crunch to pair with the flaky fish inside. The aioli brought some nice freshness and creaminess to the dish as well. Not the best I've ever had but a solid starting point. \n\nNext up, we had the chouri\u00e7o grelhado - grilled chorizo on coleslaw. The coleslaw here was rich and cool which was very important because dear god, their chorizo was hot! Hot in the spicy sense of course.... note that I am a bit of a wuss in terms of spiciness so the rest of you may laugh at me here when you order this dish. Given my previous experiences with chorizo, I wasn't expected that so the coleslaw helped soften the blow so to speak. Regardless, the chorizo was nicely grilled up and very flavourful.\n\nOur third dish was lulas grelhadas - grilled calamari with lemon vinaigrette. As one would expect from a solid Portuguese restaurant, the calamari was nicely fresh and perfectly grilled. The unique touch here was that lemon vinaigrette - creamy and acidic, it was a nice change to the usual squeeze of lemon we usually do. Note that there was still a wedge of lemon present if you wanted to but frankly that would have made the dish too lemony and not really enjoyable. \n\nThe special of the night was a portuguese poutine. Funny how I have had two Portuguese plays of poutine in such a short time apart! This one was quite good if not as rich as the previous one I'd had at Taverne F. A nice mix of flaky cod, cheese and crispy matchstick fries.\n\nFinally, to finish off the meal, we went with a staple and a family favourite - the pasteis de Nata. Served with some cinnamon, this lovely little egg tarts were the perfect end as they always are! At this rate, I should just learn to make them... I would save me some money although likely hurt the waistline somewhat!\n\nAll in all, Bitoque was a solid tapas experience from beginning to end. While perhaps nothing really stood out, the quality was consistent across every dish and we left our table stuffed food wise and having gotten to enjoy a few excellent bottles of wine without gasping at the bill at the end of the night. I would call that a win-win. Bitoque, you have officially entered my rotation of BYOWs.\n\n\nCheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Za0-WAUs879y8Yd30H3P4A"}

Because everyone's been there and done that. \nWell, no. I, for one, have never gone to IKEA. My parents thought it was expensive and far away and so I had to endure a childhood where all my friends had matching kitchen counter tops and little wood pencils to spare.\n\nBeing a fan of everything Northern and Scandinavian, the word \"Ikea\" was tied with delightful visions of tall, fair people and airy, wooden spaces. Aaahh. Imagine my surprise when I found out the local Ikea was 2 metro stations away from me! You can stop at Cr\u00e9mazie and take the 100 which drops you a block away. \nOf course, I knew through common pop culture that Ikea furniture was to be assembled by the new owner, and generally accompanied by a leaflet, only understandable by 4 different people, speaking 4-6 different languages. But that was it. My main purpose for going to Ikea, was not buying furniture but FOOD.\n\nWhen I first entered what was, to me, the promised land, I was greeted by a dozen crying babies. WTF?!?!? The day camp/playground greets you, first thing when entering. Oh joy. Second thing: the bathrooms didn't have paper to dry your hands.Where was Dolph Lundgren? Where was Alexander Skarsgard?  And my dream started to shatter :(\n\nWith the help of the much-needed plan, I found the restaurant and lined up..for 30 minutes.. We all know Ikea is cunning as hell: they present you first with the desserts, right when you're most hungry..\n I had 10 meatballs and a \"Princess cake\", The sauce and the jam really made the dish, I have to say I thought it was really pretty good, cafetaria food or not. The princess cake was the really nice surprise: a sponge cake topped by jam and cream, all covered by marzipan. Yeah, the cream is artificial, but the cake was fresh and yummy. For less than 8$, it was a heavy, satisfying meal.\n\nThat massive meal, and the sheer size if it all induced an unprecedented shopping fatigue and by the time I was in the bathrooms sections,I was ready to take a nap. I know there is a stigma to buying from Ikea, how uncool, how consummerist. But I thought everything was quite lovely and especially liked the model spaces where the actual space limitations are highlighted (\"here's what you can do with 32sq,m\"!).\n\nI had to buy some stuff at the mini supermarket, and my euro parents will be so happy to taste Gooseberry again ^^\nAll in all, I really wish a tall hunky Swede had been here to hold my hand and guide through that maze. I just found it so nerve-wracking to find my way between the floors/ rooms/ services.

My guides were shopping for a coffee table, so that was our goal.  They found the table.  We waited to check out for half of my natural life.

When I sat, I almost reached in my pocket for my phone to take a picture but then refrained. I did not want to immortalize this moment. I wanted it to be over with. Dear shoppers, do yourself and your health a favor; bring a lunch or eat elsewhere. You don't have to do this to yourself. I'm serious, you really don't have to!\n\nAlthough I will still order Ikea furniture online, I will avoid going there as much as possible in the future.

Did you say tax fraud? At one point IKEA wanted to set up shop in North Korea because the regime's labour standards and regulatory framework were just ideal (as in non-existent) for ultimate and unlimited savings. There was a time in my life when I could proudly proclaim that I've only been to IKEA .... fucking never. Now I can only gripe about those beautiful bygone IKEA-less days. Now I can proudly proclaim to have had gone to IKEA on only two occasions. Yes, folks, I've now got IKEAPTSD. Nope, that's not the Swedish name for a stylish lampshade. The fourth iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association, offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. IKEA Posttraumatic stress disorder is classified as an IKEA related anxiety disorder in the DSM IV; the characteristic symptoms are not present before exposure to the violently traumatic shopping event. That's because you didn't go to Ikea yet, stupid! The first time I went to war at Ikea was in 2013 because my partner and her roommates needed a Christmas tree. The second time I went was about three weeks ago and was akin to an executive stop-loss order. Stop-loss is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty of IKEA service under the enlistment contract by executive order of the President of the United States. I knew IKEA was a cheapo furniture store but ... I just didn't know. I just didn't know how much of a cheap ass furniture store it was. IKEA is a labyrinthine and hellish dreamscape; it is a shrine to the Golden Calf of cheap materialist shit. IKEA is the brainchild of an insane fascist megalomaniac (founder Ingvar Kamprad) and his desire for cheapo goods and services at low low prices. Such low prices that you just gave a little eight year old (senior staff) Chinese factory worker COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) because you simply glanced at that stylish and easy to assemble cardboard toilet. IKEA is an acronym that stands for Ingvar Kamprad, Elmtaryd (the farm where he grew up), and Agunnaryd (his hometown in Sm\u00e5land, south Sweden). Now, IKEA used to be Swedish (and thus beholden to Swedish tax law) but that was a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away. IKEA as I mentioned earlier is the global master of multinational corporate tax evasion and tax avoidance schemes. As a teenager, Ingvar Kamprad founded IKEA and was also a card-carrying member of the pro-Nazi New Swedish Movement (Nysvenska R\u00f6relsen) until at least 1948, causing tensions with people who don't like fascists and fascist ideology. As a fascist he learnt the ideals under which his company operates. Each and every IKEA franchise is owned and licensed by InterIKEA Holdings based in Luxembourg. That is in turn owned by INGKA Holdings based in Holland which is owned by Stiching INGKA Foundation which is the most uncharitable charitable organisation in the world (for tax purposes per chance) which is in turn owned and controlled by the Interogo Foundation based in Liechtenstein. The thing is Interogo is nothing but two tax lawyers in a shady office who answer directly to the Kamprad family. As labyrinthine as IKEA stores are, that is nothing compared to the nooks and crannies stuffed full of fascist tax evasion money ... that is what the Kamprad tax avoidance scheme seems to be. Buyer beware. On the upside the vegetarian meatballs are excellent but request that they be served to you without sauce. That sauce is really really bad ... I think it is made out of the young factory workers who are killed on the job. It's cheaper than a proper burial ... hashtag am I right(wing)? Hashtag cheap savings. Hashtag pro-Nazi faux-Swedes.

Every person I have had contact with here,from the people who answer the phones to the people at the front desk, techs and the vets themselves have seemed to have a genuine love of animals and have been nothing but patient and kind with my pets, myself and my wife.\n\nNow healthcare is never cheap and that does include animal healthcare but I have never once walked out of here feeling like I may have been overcharged or sold unnecessary procedures or services. More than once, I have brought my dog in for one thing or another and have not been charged. I also have not felt like the doctors are rushed or impatient.\n\nMy current dog has an inoperable golf ball size tumor on top of his head but the pain meds Dr Gilmore prescribed have not only kept him alive for longer than anyone expected but perfectly happy and comfortable as well. We considered putting our dog down when he was diagnosed with cancer but we still have him with us over a year later because of the care he has received at Animal Health Clinic.\n\nAs a bonus, they are located just next to NDG park. I usually arrive early for my appointments and walk my dog through the park to calm him down before going inside.\n\nBonus #2 - Animal Health Clinic sponsors the Adopt a Pet segment on the local TV news.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EI9xvGMLfVt3zXQmwi7xVg"}

I checked both my cats (17 years old) and noticed that one of them was bleeding. Upon further inspection I found that my cat had a hole the size of a toonie in her backside, deep into the flesh. I went into panic mode. As this vet is two blocks from my home I grabbed my cat in my arms and ran to the vet without so much as putting a jacket on.\n\nI entered the business bawling my eyes out holding my cat in my arms bleeding and the secretaries/assistants were immediately on their feet. The moment they saw the injury they immediately assured me that it was nothing more than an abscess and that she would be fine. Their first priority was really to calm me down (thank goodness) and make sure I understood that this was something that happened to cats quite often and that she would be absolutely fine. \n\nI was seen within ten minutes and after a brief inspection they took my cat, shaved around the area, rinsed the wound and gave me some disinfectant and two weeks of antibiotics (not to mention the cone that she just looooooved). They even offered up a container of cat little that was large pieces so that my baby wouldn't get small pieces of litter caught in her wound. \n\nThrough and through the staff were wonderful and incredibly caring. They were generous with making sure I had what I needed and making sure I understood what my cat would be needing in the following days.The pricing was far less than expected as well. Any Consultation/Examination is a $60 flat rate, and the wound cleaning was $30 which they then discounted back to me as the examination was so minimal. They did so without telling me, I only noticed after I looked at the bill a few days later. Two weeks of antibiotics was $30 and the cleanser was $5.\n\nFor $108 after tax my cat was seen by a vet, shaved, cleaned wound, antibiotics, disinfectant, cat litter, pee pads (as she was bleeding around the house) and tons of love and petting.

This establishment is also in the heart of chinatown so parking might be an issue at some times of the day if you are driving.

Located in Montreal's China Town, we were taken for a little tour in the dirtiest part of the city (and this city is probably the cleanest city Ive been to). You could instantly recognize that this was a hot spot by the many people flocking in and out of the establishment. \n\nThe first thing I liked about this style of hot pot is that its buffet. Unlike most hot pots where they serve you a certain selection of veggies that they hand picked for you, you get to choose exactly what vegetables and how much you want to put in your pot. That being said, I am not really sure how fresh the veggies are being displayed open deli style right near their front entrance. Hordes of children and families were running around using their hands when utensils were not readily available and I did not see one staff member come out to replace stale food. \nWe were told that we HAD to order the beef/lamb combo (I don't eat lamb) which left my boyfriend having to eat the whole dish. This wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't see the sign on the table that said if we wasted 200 grams of food, we would be charged another 15,99$ So basically, he filled up on food he didn't want just so I could eat the food I did want. I was not very happy about that but he seemed to be okay with it. \n\nOverall, I would have given this 2 stars because it wasn't that fantastic.

Then you have your choice of different raw meats to put in your pot. They bring out this huge pot with a divider so it contains both types of broth and let the broth simmer while you stock up at the buffet. They have every kind of vegetable, noodle and seafood you can think of; local as well as unidentifiable. As overzealous newbies, we each filled our plates with just about everything and piled it into the soup. The meat is brought out raw and cooks in the broth, much like Pho'.  The regular broth is not regular at all, it was very well seasoned with whole spices right in the pot. The spicy was screaming hot, but that is how to should be. It was all amazing and very, very filling.\n\nThe quality of the food was great, the dining experience was really fun and I would recommend this place to anyone going to Montreal.

You know, raw meat, veggies, and noodles that you choose to your liking and a sauce to compliment for a taste truly your own, bring to a giant wok and have someone braving 7 foot flames to stir fry it all for you.\n\nIt was....kinda/sorta.\n\nYou DO pick out your raw faves, but the selection was so much more vast.  Veggies included Taro, Kale, Pumpkin, Bok Chou and meats included lamb, beef, chicken, the hugest prawn I've ever seen. For a walk on the wild side, meats included chicken hearts and liver even tripe.  And for the starch-loving gal like me, why , 7 different types of noodles was akin to a choir of angles singing.\n\nInstead of bringing it to the firefighting wok master, you instead bring all of the rarities to your table where a \"hot pot\" of broth is boiling happily on your own personal burner.  You can choose from regular, hot, or super spicy broth.  I'm a chicken, so it was an order of regular for me and my brave husband chose hot.  They bring the order \"yin/yang\" where you have a pot divided in two with your respective broth choices.  \n\nThen, you drop in your fixings and wait for the bubbling action to cook your dinner, strain it, and garnish it with whichever dipping sauce you deem fit.\n\nEssentially, it's fondue with an Asian twist.  And I'd never want Mongolian any other way.\n\nIf you're in Old Towne Montreal, this is a MUST.  It's close to the Metro and easy to recognize with the fuzzy sheep sign logo in green. (Most signs were red or yellow, so it stood out)\n\nThe restaurant was very clean, staff extremely polite and helpful, and the food was perfect.

No one is going to hold your hand through this process, but I can attempt to give you a quick recipe for a good one;  2:12 hot chili oil with bits, 2:12 soy sauce, 1:12 sesame oil, 2:12 scallion/chives, 2:12 cilantro (a must have), 1:12 vinegar, 1:12 paste/minced garlic, 1:12 ginger paste.  There is also a sesame paste sauce that can be made using diluted sesame paste, but I like spicy.\n\nDon't be afraid of the watercress, and try making a hard boiled egg.  The cooked egg is delicious peeled and then dipped into your dipping sauce.\n\nThere is also a small buffet portion set up that has things like spring rolls and sesame balls.  But, I found these items not to be very fresh.  There is also an all-you-can-drink soda and juice fountain that actually has some delicious sweetened soy milk on tap and orange juice.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9HpTTSPwuh_lp2dCLiGswg"}

My sister and I come here so often that our parents have decided not to join us anymore. I love the variety of food offered and I really love the fact that it's all-you-can-eat. I think the lamb meat is the best and is super tasty with their broth. It used to be a buffet-style where you get up and serve your own food but they changed it to ordering it on a slip. It's still all-you-can-eat but the portions they give aren't always accurate so you have to keep asking for more.\n\nI usually get the individual small pots when I come here which is very cute and personalized. It gets a little difficult when the party is too big so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're more than 6 people. The yin yang broth (half spicy half non-spicy) is excellent and you get the best of both worlds. \n\nIt's rare to find all-you-can-eat Xiao Fei Yang restaurants so enjoy it here!

I am not a big tofu fan however, it goes so well with hot pot that I order more tofu than anything else!

The food was good and the place gets pretty busy. The experience was nice and it's fun to learn a new variation of Asian food. The cleanliness is a little off, but it's typical for Chinatown.\n\nHaving 3 teenagers with us, they barely ate because they read the sign about wasted food and became extremely cautious to the point where they pretty much skipped the food to eat ice cream and cake.\n\nWhile I understand the concept of not wasting food, sushi buffets will charge you $1 per piece not eaten. This place will charge you a full $19 for 200 grams of wasted food. \n\nThe whole concept of a buffet is that it's a way to try foods you would not normally eat, there is unfortunately going to be some waste, but I can say I have eaten at so many buffets now, that I can now know exactly when to stop and eat everything on my plate.\n\nBut a 15 year old or somebody who ogles the buffet and might be full earlier than expected should not be punished for that. Or somebody might pick an item and not like it.\n\nI only made one trip to the raw food buffet and there are a lot of items i skipped because I had to eat more than my share of food since others could not finish.\n\nMy suggestion is to go with people who will eat a lot, and go for the lunch buffet, it's $12 instead of $19, my 2 star review is the Overall impression and as good as the food was, the lasting taste in my mouth is the poor wasted food policy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9HpTTSPwuh_lp2dCLiGswg"}

How did I ever find myself back home in NYC?\n\nMontreal Museums Day (la Journ\u00e9e des mus\u00e9es montr\u00e9alais) was the day when 29 museums opened their doors free of charge to the public, with 5 free bus routes to take people from museum to museum, and this happens once a year. I was dying to visit as many museums as possible, but since I was traveling with a group, they voted to stick to our original itinerary :( and decided to visit the Biosph\u00e8re  to see the penguins. IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't confuse the Biosph\u00e8re with the Biod\u00f4me. They are two separate museums. If you see any pictures/reviews of animals and/or penguins, that's the Biod\u00f4me. The Biosph\u00e8re has no animals. We didn't know that, and hopped on a bus to the Biosph\u00e8re. Even though we got our museums mixed up, getting on that bus and finding ourselves in front of the Biosph\u00e8re was so worth it.\n\nFirst, I thoroughly enjoyed the ONE | Outfits from a New Era exhibit, which displays dresses created out of garbage, such as airbags, batteries, books, fish skins, and even cans of Arizona Ice Tea,  and an outfit made of hair!! Very creative and eye-opening, and a clever way of encouraging awareness of the vast amount of garbage we throw out. Second, after the exhibit we got on the elevator and went all the way to the top, where the views of Parc Jean-Drapeau (the park where the Biosph\u00e8re was located)  and the skyline of Montreal were, put simply, amazing. Also, if you ever wanted to know what it was like to be in a circular cage, this is the place to be in!\n\nWould I go back a second time? Probably not, and why? I think I have seen all there is to see in the Biosph\u00e8re since the exhibits were few in number. I was surprised there weren't more, and was in and out in a few hours. But if you're in Montreal and don't come to check this out, well, you've missed out.\n\nMerci beaucoup, la journ\u00e9e des mus\u00e9es montr\u00e9alais!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IOf7i3d1Li2rHxurX2cGdQ"}

Mmm, what does that say about the general interest in ecology and sustainability in Canada... I admit it, I'm pretty green, I'm your annoying friend with a sustainable water bottle who won't shut up about it. Did you turn off the light when you left the room?\nI also have to admit that, shamefully, I had never, as a Montrealer, set foot in the Biosph\u00e8re before. Still, I can't imagine a sky-view of Montreal without the pretty dandelion globe. \nIt's even more beautiful and surreal in person than it is in pictures, but the interior is surprisingly small and intuitive. There are different exhibitions, all revolving around natural ressources and ecology. The room dedicated to water is pretty fun since YOU have to participate in the activities and get yourself wet! You can even unleash your inner messiah and walk on water! Another cool exhibition highlights how we could reuse waste in the fashion industry, the pieces are not always practical but always pretty neat. My favourite outfit was 98% air according to the wall text! Don't miss the circular cinema room, and get to know the fauna of Quebec (little birdies! Aww)\nWhere you really want to be is at the highest floor, not only is the view spectacular, but it retraces the story of the Biosph\u00e8re and its architect's other projects such as a sustainable more efficient (and stylish) car, or how he gave his name to an atom structure and later to a common office-desk toy (bucky balls!).  \n\nI feel a very special sense of relationship with the Sph\u00e8re: it became such an icon of Expo 67, which had such a great impact on Montreal. I can't help but be proud of it, even if it was, originally, the US pavilion! But a lot of things about it make me unbearably sad: it will close, and I think we'll loose a wonderful part of our history. The lack of funds is felt: some exhibits artifacts don't work, or not as well as they should be. The rooms are a bit of a mumbo-jumbo, why aren't they organized by elements? Or regions of the world, or environmental dangers? \nAnd then I feel so small, because even tough the museum highlights how we negatively impact our world, there is no specific section on what we can do to help. What ressources are there, in Montreal, in Canada? \nGo see the dandelion before it's blown away!", "type": "review", "business_id": "IOf7i3d1Li2rHxurX2cGdQ"}

The cute window display and the woman that I just saw walking down the way with sorbet peaked my interest.  I walked in to find a variety of goodies awaiting my consumption!\n\nI decided to get vanilla macaroons, chocolate macaroons (that's all they had left) as well as pear sorbet and litchi sorbet!  They also have maple syrup ice cream which was just to die for, but I could not consume it all by my lonesome.\n\nThe vanilla macaroon was first. I took one bit and the whole macaroon opened with a bright white cream of goodness inside!  It was amazing!  Soft, creamy, and crunchy all at the same time!   Then, there was the chocolate macaroon.  At first bite, the luscious fudge center poked its head out and greeted me with intense chocolatey goodness!  This was unlike the vanilla macaroon, which I was able to eat in three quick bites.  This macaroon was meant to be enjoyed in many small bites, slowly, sensuously, and seductively.  \n\nDamn, it was good.\n\nAnd then, the gorgeous scoops of litchi and pear sorbet piled high upon a simple cone.  The sorbets are made by a quebec company, and they focus on using the freshest ingredients.  \n\nThe litchi flavor is ridiculously fresh.  It does not seem to have any artificial flavors, only the sweetness from the juice of the fruit.  Perhaps the fruit is pureed and then formed into this gorgeous sorbet?  \n\nThe pear sorbet is sweeter with rich flavor, texture smoother than the litchi, and mirroring an actual pear.  It is a wonder to me that I have not found such amazing sorbet in the states.  The canadiens know how to do it right, that's for sure. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "g3-LD-78T2g8fYamv7SndQ"}

The smell of baked goods is enough for those enzymes in your tummy, Mr. and Mrs. Ghrelin O-acyl transferase and kids to jump up and yell, FEED ME. They had special cupcake-ice cream combos that were a little less than $5--totally worth it. The service is fast and they're all smiles.\n\nI selected a carrot cake cupcake and vanilla ice cream and Pat went for the Red Velvet and vanilla. We chose two leather chairs right by the big window to sink into. And we sunk into them. People pass by and their eyes light up at the sight of ice cream cones with smiles drawn on them. The bakery smells of sweet icing and laughter. The actual store is a decent size, clean, chic and enticing to children and old folk. The bathroom is even pleasant!\n\nIf you would like to know, the cupcakes were absolutely delicious. Especially with the cold ice cream.

The contrast of hot and cold is commonly seen in dessert and it could have made this experience easily a four star one. The cupcake however was good for what it was. I chose the Red Velvet Cupcake and the flavor was that of a true Red Velvet cake. It was very moist and it had excellent flavor.

As the only un-filled option of the three the cake to cream ratio was spot on with the former dense and cocoa laden while the later was light and smooth with a bit of added sugar on the outside for texture.  Moving next to the filled options, Salted caramel was an equally well constructed cake with a light vanilla batter topped with rich buttercream frosting and a drizzle of caramel, but what set it apart was what was inside - a liquid caramel center rife with sea salt plus a light dusting of fleur de sel on top.\n\nMoving last to the Tire d'Erable, an obvious choice given the season, our location, and my predilection to anything Maple - it was probably the best cupcake I've had in 2012.  Beginning first with the same dense vanilla base as the Salted Caramel but this time swirled with maple in the batter and then replacing the buttercream ice cream with one of whipped maple butter before adding caramelized maple syrup and maple candied walnuts this was a flat out embarrassment of sweetness that pined for a glass of milk or coffee while also wishing I'd have ordered another - or picked up a few for breakfast the next day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "g3-LD-78T2g8fYamv7SndQ"}

In the end I settled for one scoop of pistachio on a sugar cone dipped in chocolate (FYI: despite being in a queue of all French-speakers, I ordered in English, and had no problems)... and it was perfect in every way possible. The pistachio wasn't in it's \"traditional\" green state, but a blissful white. It was super chunky with pistachio nuts, and had both that sweet and moderately salty flavor that was perfect on such a hot day. It also tasted even more fabulous once I hit that chocolate, crunchy cone part!\n\nI will mention that the queue was enormous; and, the more people that joined it, the more frazzled the girls behind the counter seemed.

There were four of us, so we stayed in a room with two queen sized beds, which ended up being the fourteenth floor on the top, so we kept telling people we were staying in the penthouse suite. But penthouse suite it definitely was not. One of the beds was crammed up against the wall that had the closet in it. Basically, if you wanted to get into the closet you had to climb over the bed to get to it. So hopefully when you climbed on the bed, there wouldn't be someone sleeping in it.... \n\nFirst off, there was a piece of what I think was glass, stuck to the floor in front of the fridge. I don't know how it got there, or why it was stuck, but it wasn't moving, and really it shouldn't have been my job to move it. Apparently housekeeping only works once a week? So our room, as filthy as 4 drunk people make it, was never cleaned until we left. It was pretty gross by day 3, so imagine day 6. Thank god no one threw up in there, however it came pretty damn close. \n\nThe kitchenette was nice and big, which was good, since I always seem to have trouble finding veggie restaurants in Montreal, so we were able to eat breakfast and lunch in our suite. It had an oven, coffeemaker, toaster, microwave, and a DISHWASHER! Sadly there weren't enough dishes to necessitate a dishwasher, so we washed our items by hand, which of course meant we had no dishsoap except for what was provided in powder-form for the dishwasher. Ah well, now I know for next time. I used the oven once, to make a frozen pizza, the only problem was that the fire alarm went off when I took it out. P.S. It was NOT burnt. \n\nWith no housekeeping, this meant we had to exchange our dirty towels at reception for clean ones. Not a big deal, but kind of weird. There were also ants in our hotel room. Yes, ANTS. They seemed to be hanging out around the base of the bathtub and by the broken glass stuck to the floor by the fridge. I mean, its not like they were bedbugs right? Ugggh... \n\nI guess my experience was okay, I would probably look around before booking here again. I really did like the location, since it is on the border of Old Montreal/Chinatown and the bar area, so that is definitely a win, and the staff were all very helpful and nice. I guess I just had some reservations about the way the room was set-up and the policies of the hotel, especially since I didn't see anyone else on our floor, so it seemed odd to me that if none of the other rooms were full, why they would have booked us in the one with ants and broken glass?", "type": "review", "business_id": "GmEkZ0cL2MMn6szNRfh9PA"}

Being an extended stay hotel I would have to imagine that most of the occupants are college/university students. That reason alone should make you think twice about showing up on St. Patty's day weekend. We were on the ninth floor and lucky enough to be away from the louder gaggles of children but it was wall to wall 18 year olds in the lobby when we came home at night.\n\nOur suite was a good size for two people. A relatively comfy couch and an easy chair provided some seating and the kitchenette was a welcome home for all the cheese and meat we bought. The exhaust for our stove was attached to the room next door however so our room smelled like whatever they were cooking or smoking at the time. My most confusing moment was the combination of weed and buttered toast. I wasn't sure if I had a contact high or was having a tasty stroke. Then the fried chicken smell took over and it was time to leave.\n\nHousekeeping will come if you ask for it but it's once a week otherwise. You have to take your towels and sheets down to reception if you want clean ones or you could wash them yourself in the laundry room for a few bucks.\n\nThe hotel is clean and the staff are very very nice. The elevators work and you can watch tv...ummmm...yeah that's all I've got.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay for a while and you don't mind some quirks or obnoxious neighbours, Candlewood is alright. You might want to find a place that's a little more quiet and doesn't constantly smell like cigarettes though. Your call.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GmEkZ0cL2MMn6szNRfh9PA"}

Yes, we had a few incidents with some drunken bar-people partying way too loud at midnight when we were trying to sleep because we were getting up at 6 a.m. the next morning, but they are few and far between.\n\nFor the price, it's worth it to have such sweet silence most of the time.\n\nLet me lay it out for you:\n\n1) They are really nice about letting you switch rooms. If you are in a room you hate, and you are staying a long time, you can move as many times as you want and they won't be rude to you. Well, the one asian girl downstairs was a real b*tch who was rude and annoying, but the guy and the other girls were really nice, so don't judge all of them immediately.\n\n2) The laundry is free. FREE. So is wifi and TV. OMG. You normally have to pay for laundry and the wifi in other hotels.\n\n3) Location can't be beat. Right by Chinatown, a grocery store, a mall and 2 metro stations, plus you can walk to Old Montreal.. and downtown!\n\n4) It's an old building but it can't be helped. What can be helped, is staying AWAY from the suites that they normally give to wild partygoers. \n\n5) The kitchen is fully equipped with an actual stove (a rarity sometimes).\n\n6) Did I mention that the building was actually quiet? I mean there was no constant humming of air vents and ducts outside, no strange buzzing in the walls, no constant traffic that kept you up all night because of their crap windows... the silence is a boon, even if the room isn't sexy.\n\n7) The price is right if you stay long-term, it's about $60/night which is a STEAL at that location, and if you aren't planning on getting an apartment for a year.\n\nSo yes. They may not be great for 1-2 night stays, but they are fab for long-term guests who don't care about the non-essential details, and are only interested in PURE SILENCE 99% of the time!!!!!\n\nOh and if you're getting mail delivered here, make sure you get your name in the system if you aren't the primary on the reservation, or they will reject ALL the mail that  goes there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "GmEkZ0cL2MMn6szNRfh9PA"}

Some friends of mine and I have been trekking out to Montr\u00e9al for the past four years for a music festival, and for the past four years we've been staying here with no complaints! It's a great hotel in an awesome location walking distance from Vieux Montr\u00e9al and busy St. Catherine's and St. Denis. This place is definitely doing something right!\n\nI love staying here for our week long trip because of the suites with kitchenettes and an extra bedroom! When you're travelling with friends that extra room comes in handy when you're all trying to get ready to go out to the bar at the same time, and the kitchen is fantastic! Everything you need: a fridge to keep you mix cold, a freezer to keep your alcohol chilled and ice at hand, glasses to drink from, and an extra sink to guzzle water from at 3am when you're trying to avoid a hangover! (You can also keep food in the fridge, cook food on the stove and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee from your coffee maker if you're into that sort of thing too.)\n\nThe staff are friendly and there is always someone at the front desk! I also like that housekeeping is only once a week. If i'm holiday for awhile i don't want a total stranger coming into my room to see what a total slob i am, i'd rather tidy up a bit right before i leave so they can imagine a really clean, well put-together was occupying the room after i leave. Suckers.\n\nDespite mentioning that we come here for a music festival and how much drinking and clubbing we do, my friends an I all appreciate that this hotel is so quiet! I want to be rowdy at 2am at the bar, not in the place i'm trying to sleep. Quite a few people from the music festival end up staying here (we recognize each other from our black clothing, the traditional uniform of our people) but not once have I been awoken by rowdy partying.

Another friend hit the jackpot with a large living room/kitchen area with three windows offering amazing high-rise views of the city and even a small balcony (you couldn't actually stand on it, but the window was floor to ceiling and you could open it)!

It's also an easy walk  -- 10 minutes at most -- to the Place des Artes -- which includes the contemporary arts museum, theaters, and a varitety of restaurants.  Ity'ls also where the city hosts many festivals. It's also a very easy walk to Chinatown, an IGA (grocery store).\n\nGetting to and from the airport (YUL) could not be easier.  The #747 bus stops right across the street.  The single fare is $10 -- which gives you unlimited public transit access for the day.  If you are going to be in Montreal for several days -- get the extended pass, which is good  for buses and the Metro.  The main train station is an easy cab or bus ride, and is also walkable.\n\nWe found the staff very cooperative, bi-lingual and friendly.  The rooms are large and the kitchen adequately equipped.  \n\nWhat surprised us is that there was a water heater in our room. We're not sure if each room has one, but hot water was not a problem.  The water pressure is excellent, which makes for great showers.  There is ample closet space, which helps as drawer space is somewhat limited.\n\nWe found the bed to be comfortable and the bed linens fine.\n\nHowever....the positives are outweighed by several things.\n\n*  Housekeeping.  While the room was geneerally clean, we found a few things that attentive housekeeping would have addressed including two coffee cakes left in a kitchen cabinet by a previous guest. The were unopened with crumbs everywhere.  Fortunately there were no bugs.  Also, each unit has a garbage disposer.  Ours had not been checked, nor run, so when you pulled the cover out, there was a foul odor.  Housekeeping is done by request only.  Units are cleaned once a week.\n\n*  Decor/Furninishings.   The bottom line is the place needs a facelift.  Furnishings, while adequate, are old.  We were surprised there was no dining table or opportunity for two people to eat at once.  It's obvious the hotel has not been painted in a while and routine maintenance is basic -- some switchplates that were removed were not covered and it appears that replacements for such item as the shower rod and sink drain were done quickly and cheaply.  While the bed linens are nice, bathroom towels seem old and in need of better laundering. They weren't dirty, just worn.\n\nWould we stay there again?

They were crisp but kind of small and dry...with only a side of barbecue dipping sauce that had a bit of a kick.\n\nWhile it satisfied and wet the whistle, with all of the good places to eat around this part of town, it's easy to give this place the once over and walk on.

First of all I really like the concept of this brew pub chain. They brew five pretty good beers, they also have beer of the month, seasonal choices as well as beer competition between the different brew pub locations once a year. The tasting flight called \"l'etch\u00e9t\u00e9ra\" is a great option to sample their classical beers. The varlet (1 litre glass) may be perfect if you are really thirsty and don't mind the heavy lifting. \n\nTrois Brasseurs has solid menu with delicious flammekueche choices, some good meat dishes and my beloved popcorn style crusty fried shrimp. What I particularly like in this location is the maxi poutine. You won't find it on the menu, but for an extra of two dollars they will substitute the regular fries with the maxi ones. I have to say this is one of my favourite poutine in town and it has been pretty consistent as quality. Sometimes the person bringing the food will be too much focused on bringing all the dishes together and you may get your plate a little bit cooled off, some other time the waiter may be a little bit distracted and you will end up with something you haven't asked for. Regardless the guys are willing to correct their small mistakes and service is overall ok. \n\nAs this is a pub located in the old port, its atmosphere is quite unique, the pub is housed in one of the old stone walls buildings. The front part of the pub has tall tables and could be drafty during the cold winter months, on the other hand the back part of the pub is sheltered, but the kitchen personnel tends to open some door periodically and introduce more cold  air. The best part to sit is really in the middle of the pub, warm and protected, perfect for those who have decided to freeze on the skating rink or during other outdoor winter activities, and need to warm up. Finally the vibe of this pub is relaxed and this is another reason I like going there. Cheers!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lvMZVGiWH12U1mRkSI25DQ"}

The things they have in common? Delicious [insert item here], terrible service.\n\nSo, Les 3 Brasseurs was a random stop. We were wandering the beautiful cobbled streets when we realized we were hungry. We started to incorporate menu perusing into our wandering, and the menu here caught our eye, not only for the food (which was blessedly lacking in the poutine arena), but also for the beer.\n\nWe chose to sit outside, which probably wasn't very smart. The patio is small, and they squeeze way more tables and chairs out there than is advised. I watched several couples in the aisle next to us passive-aggressively bumping chairs into the patrons at the table behind them. It wasn't the customer's fault, really. The restaurant should have known better than to try to fit 30 tables and chairs into a space that could only really fit 20 on a good day.\n\nAt any rate, both times that we stopped here, we chose to sit outside. I do love to people watch. I found the waitstaff to be lacking on both occasions, but what the heck - we were there for the booze. \n\nMy husband absolutely fell in love with their L'Ambree (American amber/red ale) - it was the only thing he ordered on both visits. Meanwhile, I wanted to try as much as I could, so I started with the Brune (brown), then moved on to the Blanche (white), before trying the seasonal brew, the Summer Fresh Raspberry Ale. \n\nWow, that makes me sound like a lush. I'll have you know this was over the course of two visits, thank you. I'm just not divulging how many of each beer I tried. =)\n\nThe Blanche was by far my favorite. It was smooth, with a light citrus flavor. It wasn't an overly wheaty wheat beer, if that makes sense. I don't know how else to describe it. The Brune was also very good - it had a deep, nutty flavor without being too heavy or having too overpowering a finish. My least favorite was the raspberry ale. I did like it, but not nearly as much as the other two. I had expected an overpowering raspberry (or at least sweet) flavor, but it never came through. That might be good - I would expect a raspberry flavor to dominate the beer itself - but I was looking for at least a hint of sweet or raspberry. It was, however, a very light and refreshing beer, perfect for a hot and sunny day on the patio.\n\nBoth times we went, we went light on the food ordering. Our first time there, we shared the charcuterie platter and an order of the beer mussels. It took for-freaking-EVER for the food to get to us. We were both on our second beer by the time the plates hit our table (and feeling it, too...or maybe that was just me?)\n\nWhile the food was decent, it certainly did not make sense that we waited over 40 minutes for a small board of meat and cheese and a plate of mussels. To add to the mild frustrations (mild because I was tipsy by then), the waitress never once came by to check on us, or to give us an update on our food. Not that I needed a play-by-play, but knowing that our food wasn't forgotten would have been nice.\n\nOur second time there, our waiter coldly told us that we'd have to order something to eat if we wanted to stay on the outdoor patio - apparently you couldn't just drink beer out there. That was fine, as we were once again planning on a light snack, but he absolutely could have phrased in a nicer tone of voice.\n\nThat time, we each ordered a Caesar salad, which again took much longer to come out than I would have expected. I also never expected to get bacon on my Caesar. I should have read the menu a bit closer, I guess. I love bacon, it just was not what I was banking on when I placed that order, so ever piece of bacon from my plate ended up on my husband's. He was in heaven.\n\nSo yeah - service not so great, but that beer, though! My husband still says that if they exported that amber, he'd buy it by the case. I kind of feel the same way about the Blanche.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lvMZVGiWH12U1mRkSI25DQ"}

This is the secret to most secondary and hospital food preparation. Shared, no doubt, by the good people at Golden Corral. How Les 3 Brasseurs manages to put out dish after dish of room temperature, slightly wet sandwiches and burgers, is a miracle of ineptitude. It staggers the imagination that this location is almost constantly full during lunch and holiday months, and it fails to attempt to produce any memory other than that of being ripped off in a noisy, child-filled environment that plays offensively bad music and mind-numbingly stupid videos (are these house made, as well?). \n\nStay far away from the rock hard soft pretzels and the rueban sandwich and the mystery meat burgers. The beer is often decent. The shrimp, when warm, can reach the rarified heights of a Northern Ohio Abblebys mid-management change. Ask for anything fresh and warm before placing an order, if you must go here. That way you have an out if you need to, and you will need to, send something, or everything back.

If anything some of the Joe Fresh stuff is frankly cuter than the sometimes-mom-like Monaco. And it's convenient that these are connected to Loblaws here in Canada, and funny that the sexy versions in NYC are decidedly un-grocery. \n\nThis Joe Fresh in particular is in a huge, stunning historic old train station. The beauty of the building almost makes me sad at the Joe Fresh though, first of all because they barely make use of all the space (the mezzanine!! c'mon!! it just sits empty!!) and because the contrast between the globalization-wear pumping through the buttery marble, soft bronze, inspiring vault of a ceiling, etc is almost too much to bear. It would be so cool if this could be more of a public space. An arts venue! A library! A skill share!

Joe- us pregnos would love a maternity line!\n\nThis Joe Fresh isn't in the supermarket, but has it's own store connected to it. Personally I like that better since it seems a bit strange to me to shop for clothes while shopping for groceries. It's a beautiful space and most importantly they have a HUGE kids selection. I had only about 45 minutes until I had to leave for the airport (I literally was rolling my suitcase around the store) and filled my arms with tons of clothes for my little girl at home, as well as my baby boy on the way.  Thank goodness I had just had my gender revealing ultrasound just days before stepping into this Joe Fresh.\n\nThe total came to about $300 for what seemed was an entire fall/winter wardrobe for both kids.  I had a bit of a paranoid moment when my VISA didn't go thru and they don't take AMEX.  Canada doesn't seem to want to take my money! Fortunately, my Canadian coworker came thru for me and put the clothes on her credit card...and I wrote her a check.\n\nI'm still not sure how I fit all the new clothes in my suitcase, but it helps that clothes for toddlers and newborns are extremely small.

The fabrics are too thin and cheap looking. They used to have basic tees and tank tops that would withstand many washes but now they get stretched out too easily and don't seem to last. The styles and prices remind me of H&M, only, the fit is a little too loose and not made for the tall and thin. Pants are always short for me. \n\nMy favorite items are from their sleepwear and lounge collection, and I particularly like their clearance aisle - you can always find nice pieces for less than 10 bucks.

Unless we are talking palace and hi end cuisine.\n\nSomehow it is hard for me to judge the Renoir as I have only had a brunch there. But I must admit, what a brunch. This is probably one of the best brunch Montreal has. And if you still have room for desert, well they have the best \"millefeuilles\" you will ever encounter. And trust me as I am usually not a big fan of them. \n\nYou will find an array of amazing deserts, but not only as the buffet grants you the possibility of a healthy brunch as much as a decadent one.\n\nSo basically, if you are in need of a nice brunch, be assured that you have. A nice spot right here at the Renoir.\n\nThe only thing that could be improved is probably the setting of the restaurant. Indeed more than the setting, it's mainly the furniture that kind of makes me not over excited.  This is true for not only for the Sofitel hotels, but for most hotels that tend to rely on furnitures that are really of average quality, and that brings a spirit of \"cheapness\" to the places. Unfortunately, over affordable solutions, often from China, seduces way to many hotels around the globe, and in the end it shows.", "type": "review", "business_id": "ela9Je2E3cvqKKA8n9jZMg"}

We were stuck between flights, unaware at that point that our four-hour layover would end up lasting sixteen thanks to Air Canada's rubber band breaking on their flying yak.  Before realizing this fact, we took a break at Cabine M, and credit given for having a unique name.  Not sure what the M stands for, Montreal or Marcotte (found on their menu).  The d\u00e9cor was simple enough, and I liked the dividing wall offering some measure of privacy.  However, I doubt the wall of wine on the near wall has ever been opened.\n\nBeyond their simple menu, they also offer a chef's tasting page designed (apparently) by something called HMSHost, which I discovered later was some gigantic conglomerate responsible for menus and meals for other restaurants specialized in catering to travelers.  Why travelers needed their own specialized menu, I'll never know.  Apparently Cabine M (Marvel?) couldn't be bothered to design one on their own...I guess?  Odd that they'd call it a Chef's Tasting since obviously the chef on tap at Cabine M (Mancy?) had no hand in the creation of this menu.  Odd coincidence, HMSHost is owned by Autogrill, something I would get to know very well on my upcoming trip to Italy (the same one delayed).  \n\nSo yeah, we ordered the tasting menu.  For $26, it promised (apparently) four starter courses and your choice of one protein among three.  Sounds like a steal.  Here is where things get a little muddy: a tasting menu involves several plates over a long period.  What Cabine M (Math?) did was throw all five selections on a single plate and serve it all at once.  I ordered the rosemary grilled chicken breast.  The tasting starters promised a \"reversed nacho\", roasted asparagus, Caesar salad, and a chef's potato.  Let's call this out for what it was--a full page advertising a single plate of food.  Talk about pretentious.  The chicken breast was resting on the asparagus and potatoes, next to the salad with four tortillas resting in a small cup of salsa.  \n\nNo, you're right, squirting tube-fed salad dressing over uncut Romaine with three croutons on top equates avante garde.  Why the hell, did this plate require a page of detail?  It's one plate of food.  It wasn't bad, but holy crap, was that a lot of hype for what amounted to very little food.  I counted five potatoes the size of D&D dodecahedrons.  Three, count'em, three tortillas.  Three croutons over uncut Romaine.  Even the chicken wasn't very big, and this restaurant needed to outsource this page to a giant multi-national conglomerate?\n\nI don't think I have properly explained how exaggerated this plate was.  This entire offering required 55 words on its own isolated laminated page.  The nachos, asparagus, potatoes, and salad were each given their own paragraph with header and description.  Each possible alternate protein had its own suggested wine offering.  Not even posh bistros in downtown London have the gall to put this much effort into a single plate of food.  If it was stellar, an iconic upper echelon of gastronomic bliss, I could see about giving them a pass, but at the end of the day, it was simply okay.  I can't stand it when restaurants go the artsy fartsy approach to salad--uncut lettuce with squirted dressing, forcing me to make a mess with knife and fork in order to enjoy a simple salad.  Sorry, Cabine M (Mediocre...), get a real tasting menu designed by your local chef and try again, and use less words this time.    \n\nFood:  2.5/5\nService:  3/5\nPresentation:  2.5/5\nValue:  3/5\nRecommendation:  2.75/5", "type": "review", "business_id": "hPcvSu-DkZ_s0vwM-NktGg"}

Based in Montreal, Frank and Oak sells high quality clothing, classic in style, for a very affordable price.  The secret here is that they control every aspect of the process with a vertically integrated structure.  Design, material sourcing, manufacturing and sales is all handled in house.  So, while the clothes themselves lack the brand name recognition, they are very well made.  Sizing is a bit questionable at times, with many of their button down shirts made for European male models.  In addition, their pants often don't go any larger than a 36 or 38, and their blazers top out at 46R.  Both are too small for my frame.\n\nUnlike services such as Trunk Club, Bombfell and Five Four, the clothing selected for monthly shipments isn't chosen for you.  Rather, you select from a curated list of 50 or so items.  Not hard, but not as automatic as other services.  On the plus side, every purchase you make results in credits earned for future purchases.  So, not only are the prices low to begin with, you can eventually earn enough credits for free items.  You can also gain credit on referrals.  On the negative side, it takes awhile to process and ship out orders.  It can be 7-10 days before an order arrives, which is far too long in my opinion.\n\nAlthough I am relatively new to Frank and Oak, I like what I've received thus far and appreciate that their styles, while classic in nature, differ from my usual go-to, Banana Republic.  I'll continue to give them a go and see what happens!", "type": "review", "business_id": "9e42a9MVYBqJOfArmQoOIA"}

And it has been a great experience so far.\n\nI hate going out to shop for clothes. I also rarely shop for clothes. And I am very picky and particular in terms of what I want in style. I am always looking for a classic, timeless style in clothing. And it's hard to find when out physically shopping. Maybe because I don't go out looking hard enough? I don't know, I have better things to do than search for clothes :P\n\nI scrolled through Frank and Oak and found a few things I liked and ordered them: a casual button shirt, a thicker grey button overshirt, and jeans.\n\nEverything fits great. Their sizing charts and sizing information are very accurate. If you fall within the perimeters of their sizing style, the fit will be great.\n\nI am 5'8, 155 pounds, 30' waist, athletic build and their clothes so far have fit like a glove. I am very impressed by the sizing and quality of the material. I am also impressed by the style.\n\nI will definitely be a repeat customer and will order as I find items/styles I like.\n\nMy only word of caution would be to closely check their sizing chart/sizing guides and make sure their sizing style will work for you. I was fortunate that for my body type, it fits extremely well.\n\nAlso, Hunt Club is a great deal because of the free shipping and 8% back.

The pair of pants took TWO ENTIRE MONTHS to ship. TWO MONTHS! I emailed Frank & Oak about four weeks in, and every week or so after that.

Absolutely ridiculous. \n\n4. My friend has ordered from them as well and loves it, so when a bunch of sales went up for Black Friday I ordered another pair of pants (hoping that this different style would fit a wallet) and a beautiful looking briefcase. Shipping was supposed to take 4-6 weeks. After 6 weeks, I emailed them. A couple weeks later I got a message saying essentially \"we regret to inform you that the briefcase you selected is out of stock\". I emailed them asking for a replacement in a different color (they advertise many different types) and still have not gotten a response, two months later. \n\n5. FINALLY got the second pair of pants.

I ended up getting voicemail which I couldn't leave one because the mailbox was full.\n\nI sent them an email. No response.

It seems F&O like to charge my credit card for inventory they don't actually have.  Having ordered two shirts, I received one along with a letter explaining that the other would follow shortly.  After a month of no additional information, I decided to call.  It seems someone at F&O marked the second shirt as shipped (\"oops, human error\").  Had I not called to check on the status of my order, I would have been charged $40 for an item that apparently wasn't in stock to begin with.\n\nBut get this--the customer service rep was more concerned with why I hadn't ordered more crates as part of the Hunt Club!  F&O tried to rip me for $40, and the majority of the phone call was dedicated to discussing why I'm not ordering monthly crates.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1.  It is *your* responsibility to ensure that items you have already paid for actually arrive at your home.  If you get a letter saying that some portion will be delivered at a later date, write it down so you don't forget.  F&O are happy to keep your money for undelivered product and attribute it to \"human error.\"\n\n2.  Two rivets popped off a $50 pair of F&O jeans I was wearing today.  Of all the denim I have ever purchased--from Target to Macy's--this has never happened.  In addition to billing issues, there may be a quality issue.\n\n3.  The shipping itself is slow.  An order placed today should be expected to take 3-4 weeks for delivery.  As part of the Hunt Club, shipping was free so I won't belabor the point too much.  Just know that shipping is slow.\n\nI really like the style that Frank and Oak offers.  The designers should not be faulted.  The accounting, shipping and fulfillment are another story.

I have some short, slender friends who say they fit great, but at 5'11\" and 180 Lbs, their clothes are too short, to wide in the shoulders, and too tight everywhere else. Also, from one item to the next the fit is completely different, which makes no sense for a company who primarily sells their clothing online. The one shirt from them that I did end up keeping (a polo style shirt) got really wide and short after a cold wash and hang dry, and the seams are now twisted, showing the poor quality of the manufacturing and materials. \n\nRemoving myself from their Hunt Club and email list was a ridiculous venture - I called, waited on hold, spoke to someone who could barely speak English (they're based in Montreal) and was impolite to boot.\n\nOn a recent trip to Montreal, I happened upon their store. I was hoping that maybe I could try some clothes on and inspect the quality before buying, so I went in, as I'd like to try and support this independent Canadian brand. They have a coffee bar and barbershop inside their store, which seems like a really cool idea. And then they earned their single-star review:\n\nAfter looking at over a dozen garments and even picking a few up and holding them in front of myself while looking in a mirror, I was never approached. I even walked up to a girl who was deeply involved in a chat with one of their barbers (turning out yet another shaved sides with a top-knot hipster cut) and she made eye contact and then turned and looked away. Maybe she didn't work there, but it's the middle of winter and she had no coat... Who knows. Meanwhile my wife found an accessory she wanted to buy as a gift so she went to purchase it. The guy behind the counter was snotty as hell, and you need to have an online account to buy anything in the store. I gave my info, and now I'm getting their stupid emails again. We weren't greeted, thanked, or encouraged to return. I'm very disappointed that the proprietors of this shop have allowed it to become a hipster exclusive place where if you're not part of their snotty scene your money isn't welcome. I left feeling uncool and unimportant, and I will never go back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9e42a9MVYBqJOfArmQoOIA"}

For someone who worked in TV for 15 years, I have bought my share of clothing both by retail and on-line, proper and casual but this entire process was quite special.\n\nPROS: Montreal/Can company, slick and interactive website, original and quality style clothing, proper sizing, fair pricing, unique 'Hunt Club' membership and instant chat with actual rep.\n\nCONS (sort of): While I did receive my order quickly, I first inquired about why nothing seemed to be processed a few days after the purchase and that is when someone took control and shipped the package that day. Not a complaint but rather a tip!\n\nAfter reading many other reviews, I was very skeptical of going through with my order (shoes, pants, shirt and sweatshirt). But PLEASE, DO NOT HESITATE!!\n\nMy greatest worry was the sizing. I am a fairly big guy (6'0, 225) so, I was afraid that if made cheaply, the clothing would not fit me. But that was not the case. Quite the opposite actually! The pieces look great, well crafted and the sizing is true to description. Even the jeans fit very well. A pleasant surprise when buying on-line.\n  \nIt's easier to complain than to praise but F&O is deserving of this positive review.

The Frank & Oak representative assured me that safe and ethical labour is on a list of important things somewhere and that the CEO visits the Chinese factories every year. I pressed on and asked if they had any evidence as proof as to how they can ensure these claims to be true. I also asked about how visiting Westerners (the CEO) could be confident that they weren't being taken on tour of a \"bait and switch\" factory as opposed to the actual facilities. He was unable to provide any evidence. He went on to inform me that they rely upon a third party contractor to ensure that labour standards are met.

I had the table d'hote which, for 17 dollars brought me a caesar salad, a leg chicken quarter, rice and cole slaw, as well dessert (I opted for the huge portion of pouding chomeur with ice cream) and a coffee.

Chicken is always great: crunchy tasty skin, moist and tender flesh. Great rice and that coleslaw (traditional,oil based, I am not a fan of the creamy one) I could eat buckets of every day.\nI also had a Bombay Sapphire gin and tonic which brought the total bill to about 47 dollars which is good. Needless to say, Maryse's service deserved a great tip.\nBy the way, chomeur means unemployed in French. Now I know why they call it pouding chomeur.

It's only been around for five months..! Hopefully people will start coming more often though because their food was excellent. My sister and I both had the eggs florentine with a side of potatoes, and it was one of the yummiest eggs I've had since moving to Montreal. Not on an English muffin, but on toast, yet still remarkably satisfying and filling you to the point where you're not going to burst..! Good portions, relatively good prices, and great service!

Why was it empty?!\n\nCool atmosphere. \n\nThe waitress initially seemed like a stuck up snob, but by the end of the night (2 hours) she was actually pretty awesome. Fast, nice, eventually willing to communicate in English with us (I know, it's your country and you speak French there. Awesome, but help a girl out. My French only goes so far). \n\nIt's hard to talk about the food. We've never had this type of cuisine before, and I think we just didn't appreciate it. It wasn't great and I left hungry and disappointed. Again, I think it's because I've never had bone marrow, fore gras....If this was a type of food I liked, maybe I'd have been more impressed. \n\nThe drinks were tasty and awesome. I liked the Kungfu Girl Reisling, but was rather bummed that I learned how cheap it is outside in the real world- I definitely got ripped off at La Societe. \n\nThe dessert was AMAZING.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Pw6EZXm-xFehRDGItBVopw"}

Next, I chose the Rosemopolitan, which is a cosmo with rosewater. YUM! I love anything rose flavored so this was such a delight. It had a nice rose scent and didn't taste very cosmo-ey. My friend had a midori sour, but the bartender never made one before so it didn't come out as expected.

If your ideal meal is chicken tenders and fries, don't lose hope.  I was actually feeling fancy, and by fancy I mean plain pasta with butter.  I can feel you judging me but that's alright.  My husband ordered something he found to be absolutely delicious off the menu, ironically, my 16 month old son loved that too.  I went ahead and asked for pasta with butter only and it was actually amazing.  The pasta must be hand made- cooked perfectly and it had a lot of taste for what some might consider a bland meal.  I always appreciate flexibility with my child like love of simple foods and my husband is a foodie so a place that can make us both happy is 5 stars.  \n\nTIP: When you order the pasta with only butter, be sure you specify NO CHEESE.  Not sure where this gets lost in translation, but it's always good to be very specific with not just what you want, but what you do not want so the chef doesn't try to \"spice\" it up with his own idea of what would taste better.\n\nThe wine menu is beautiful and your only issue will be picking just one (bottle, obviously).  \n\nMerci, La Societe!!

The menu cards were sticked to the island and you have to order them. The menu on the LCD screens wasn't there. Not sure why they turned them off.\n\nI ordered 6 piece chicken nuggets, a glass for a soft drink and a chicken tender sandwich. It costed me 17 freaking dollars. They were guzzling money at this place. I would get that whole order under $10 in United States, considering the conversion rate, the cost should able atleast below $15. \n\nAnyways, I enjoyed my ice tea and the chicken nuggets. Not sure why I didn't like the chicken sandwich. It tasted weird. \n\nThe person who was taking order was French and doesn't understand English. So, you have to show him the number on the paper to place the order. It was funny though!", "type": "review", "business_id": "HvP4Tvx9mihceKb2gnbhgw"}

The place is dirty, filthy, full of garbages. The manager doesn't seems to care, or actually he does care about the pictures I am taking. The cashier couldn't take our order until the person in the kitchen was back from the \"toilet\"!!!!!  Oh well I guess this is Burger King's way to care for their customers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HvP4Tvx9mihceKb2gnbhgw"}
